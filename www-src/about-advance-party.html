    <a href="http://advanceparty.com.au/">Advance Party</a> is an active research, prototyping and development
    team at The Royals.

    Each quarter we initiate and deliver a series of investigations around a central theme, such as Voice
    Interfaces, Automated Agents and Synthetic Reality. We deliver programs that helps us imagine and document
    the impacts these changes will create, and we share those prototypes to facilitate innovation and
    thoughtful consideration of the future of media.
