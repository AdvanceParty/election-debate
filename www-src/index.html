          Now look, just a couple of things. I trust you're on top of all of this, I'm not suggesting you're

          Now we’ve got to get stuck into some of the matters of the day and of course there’s $60 million
          you’re pledging to build this so-called Cairns Tropical Enterprise Centre. We’re talking about

          And the country. I think we are, but I will go through the Parliament - that's why we do what is not
          true. What is suggested is that over time when you say controversial, some in the world is at war

          Various Labor candidates and MPs have had differing positions on Adani, it seems a little confusing
          what the party's actual position is. What do you say to the suggestion that you've created that
          situation by saying one thing to people in regional Queensland and one thing to environmentalists?
