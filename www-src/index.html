    <h2>Rebuilding politicians with neural networks</h2>
    <p>
      What happens when you train neural networks on Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten's language? Well it's
      scary how far you can get to replicating in just a couple of days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advance Party's crack at using neural networks to dissect the authenticity - or lack their of - coming
      from our political leaders was a mid-campaign thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      We trained Cyberbill and RoboScoMo on more than 120,000 words spoken by their human counterparts. The
      results aren't perfect, but you can already see pet themes and phrases stasrting to pop up for both
      leaders. Since the accuracy of a neural network improves over time with more training and more data, you
      can start to get a taste of how accurate something like this could become.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can <a href="interview.html">try it out for yourself</a>, by asking your own questions or picking
      samples from real campaign interviews. The answers won't fool anybody just yet, but you should see even
      with a very short amount of training, the models have started to pick up on key phrases and styles of
      each leader.

        <h3>Interview the Leaders</h3>
        <p>
          Ask them anything. We promise the answers will be at least as illuminating as the real thing.

        <p>
          We took a few choice samples from the neural network and dropped them into election campaign
          posters.
