        What happens when you train neural networks on Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten's language? Well it's
        scary how far you can get to replicating in just a couple of days.

    <h2>What's it all about?</h2>
    <p>
      Recently, we've been spending some time tinkering with neural networks. About a week before the
      Australian Federal election, we noticed that one of our models was behaving like a politician on the
      campaign trial: stubbornly churning out whatever it wanted to, regardless of what we were asking it.</p>
      <p>Which led a to a burst of absurd inspiration:</p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      What would happen if we could build two neural networks, one for Bill Shorten and one for Scott
      Morrison, and engaged them in a conversation?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Would they make any sense? Would the models pick up on specific themes, phrases and or ideas from each
      leader? After all, so much of political campaigning is about hammering away at the same themes and songs
      over and over again -- perfect fodder for neural networks which thrive on pattern recognition and
      imitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we trained Cyberbill and RoboScoMo on more than 120,000 words of transcripts from speeches and
      interviews with their human counterparts. The results aren't perfect, but you can already see pet themes
      and phrases starting to pop up for both leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can <a href="interview.html">try it out for yourself</a>, by asking your own questions or picking
      samples from real campaign interviews. The answers won't fool anybody just yet, but you can start to
      imagine how much more accurate the modelling could become with more data and longer training.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a neural network?</h3>
    <p>In nutshell, it's a type of programming architecture designed to be exceptionally good at finding patterns in data, and generating predictions or analysis based on those patterns. Check out the <a href="neural-networks.html">neural networks</a> page.</p>
