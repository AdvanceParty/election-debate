    <h2>Rebuilding politicians with neural networks</h2>
    <p>
      What happens when you train neural networks on Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten's language? Well it's
      scary how far you can get to replicating in just a couple of days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advance Party's crack at using neural networks to dissect the authenticity - or lack their of - coming
      from our political leaders was a mid-campaign thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      We trained out robo-politician on more than 120,000 words spoken by Morrison and Shorten. The results
      aren't perfect. The more you train the system the more accurate it gets.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can <a href="interview.html">try it out for yourself</a>, by asking your own questions or picking
      samples from real campaign interviews. The answers won't fool anybody just yet, but you should see even
      with a very short amount of training, the models have started to pick up on key phrases and styles of
      each leader.

          Ask them anything. We promise the answers will be at least as illuminating as the real thing.

        <p>
          Just for giggles, we also asked the neural network to generate a bunch of campaign posters. We've
          posted some of the more creative ones over <a href="campaign-posters.html">Campaign Posters</a>.
