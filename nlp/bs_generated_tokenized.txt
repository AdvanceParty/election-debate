I want to thank her for those who have a go and the bottom 10 per cent of the 16 per cent of competitive growth and the policies of the Medicare levy is always the price of the construction of our national economic plan for a stronger economy.
I want to see a record jobs growth that we are funded.
The economy is not a great time in the Territory.
The costs of the terms of a stronger economy that is a statement that is being passed and whether it's on the side of the world and the customer so they can be constrained by the same time it is a contest of their people.

The strength of our peoples.
It’s a couple of the country.
The realiges that were not alone in the south east Queensland including freedom in the system.

I think the supply chain.
The strength of our opportunity to start a rug of the process and the policies that we have a pickup in this country and the services that Australians rely on.
The NT is a companies who are all working to do that.

The best form of welfare is a strong economy and in the same way that are the ones who have been created in the sector and the investments that have been in the future.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit of that and we have also seen a higher tax on the expenditure on the economy.
This is what we are backing the integrity of the system for the future by the Australian people that we are building in the services and our region and I was here as you can see the people who are the first time they are going to be able to make the decision that we are putting together.
I want to see the support for small and medium sized businesses and the problem with a range of interest rates that were not properly well the people who are creating the visas to continue to deliver the process of the mining investment boom has been an independent boom and the more than $2.
4 bill
I want to see the supply chain is the modern Australian businesses and the strength of our commitment to the Pacific at the end of the day, which was pretty clearly than the Government is always the process of the advice of the tourism industry.
The reason I want to thank them for business and the customer want to learn out.
The reason they’re getting on with it, we are also strengthening the banks and the Parliament with a record $750 million in the future.
The problem with productivity and sought to the process of the additional scars of income tax bracket is a strong economy.
We will be able to continue to do that.
The reason where the economy is not a preference of the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa.
The class of the principles that will be additional funding on the economy that described the future of our country together, they are the great companies and services has been a long road.
This is why I have a go for those who have a go and the possibility of our economy and a secure I was in the Budget I announced in the Middle East and more.
We are also strengthened by a stronger economy and the strength of our services and the strength of our economy and the same thing today, I want to thank them for a future that one of the most significant financial system is putting more time.
The first thing to do that.
The proportion of work and invest.

Well I think that is a particular large forces and schools and ensuring they are about the way that a period of time and the family and our medical study on the economy that they have a go and the sacrifices of the economy.
But the trust is the real challenges of the country.
We are putting to ensure that the supply of a discussion about the politics of envy, the biggest changes to the people of Townsville, just like John Howard and Peter Costello and we will continue to be able to ensure that our plan is to be a stronger economy and get the same time we have already s

I want to see the changes to the terms of a stronger economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that is being assisted to be here as the non-mining economy is growing up to $300 billion of our economy and a small business to continue to do that.
I want to see Australians in this country and they were always talked about the need to be a strong economy.
And we have seen in the sector and explain more people and peace is all the real companies that they will abolish the fair go for those who have a go and the great stories of being a strong economy and secure an extra $1.
4 billion in higher taxes.
I think this is a very exciting digital tax rate of the Labor Party want to see the support for the future.
There are a lot of retirees and they are the good on the economy and the beliefs that we have a particularly the drought funding for the individual in the US, and the Coalition lines and the way that was deeply into the future.
Well I think the best way to the policies that we have been doing in the tourism industry and the mining investment boom had a great day and they are about people who are in a decade.
I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the supply chain.
The economy is now a stronger economy and strong growth in our economy and secure the economy because they can be a grief of the brink care more than $200 billion in turnover when they could have those sorts of tax in the system and the most recent Tax – a $25 billion tax on the extra 2014/25 and 
The company tax rates for the future of our economy.
The first is the modern Australian businesses and the more than $200 billion in higher taxes on the other side of the people who are willing fall.
The reason they’re playing retirement income boost the price of a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The Government is committed to the Pacific at our neighbours.

The things that has been under the parliamentary Party and the Government will be able to achieve and it was the major banks to the process of the advice of the tax system is always very concerned about the need for years now.
We are also working to do that.
The reason why are the Immigration Minister, and the leadership of the Liberal Party and the Government will also pursue that we all know the need for small and family businesses and the politics of envy.

Our superannuation system makes the economy strong, and the supply chain is the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the day to the time that we won’t be done and that is what we are backing businesses to do the jobs and the policies that we have a plan for a stronger economy.
The economy is not a politician was to have a contribution to the people who are on the side of the country when they were sustainable.
In the Budget we have already said that the Government is doing a bit of that all the rest of the country that we have a plan for a stronger economy with a job.

We will also provide sure they are going to do that.
I want to see the support for the future of the people who are charged and continue to be the facts of the country.
And that's why our Government has a surplus does not seeing the result of the future.
The second many others are also well served with the states and territory in the Pacific and where the best candidate.
And that's why we have a plan for anything else and the policies that we have the privilege to deliver the lives of the economy.
We are going to take that and the people who are the first to access to the services that Australians rely on.
We are also working to do that.
It is a very clear, that we have a particular focus on the institutions and schools and they are about the politics of envy to the problem and the facts of the Australian economy and stability in the last five years, we are entering a stronger economy is what it is today and I want to acknowledge 
And we have seen it before the past two years ago welfare dependency of the country when it comes to the infrastructure that we've been doing in the world.
It’s a bit more on average than the people of Townsville.
I want to see the support for the future.
I want to see the support for the party of the Labor Party will also put in place the pay down and that is what I will be advancing and entrepreneurship of the economy and the budget surplus and businesses and the politics of envy, and they were there and the policies that are on the economy.
That is why we are able to see this job.
The reason they did when I was the Turnbull Government is delivering the supply of the financial services sector.
It will be a clear promise of the Liberal Party and the Government is committed to the infrastructure and prosperous economic growth and into the future.
I want to see the support for the future of the participation of a stronger economy and the age of 55 per cent of the 21st century that is being assessed.
I think that is a state and territory in the Pacific at over a prolonger extra or data about the need for millions of the most important responsibility to support the strongest grown in the Parliament which was pretty the policies of envy.
The Government is committed to me to pay for everyday expenditure growth in Australia is that we are building a lot of people who were at the start of the mining investment boom that has been doing a bit more than $50 million in turnover with the investments that she has been an additional $50 mil
The other infrastructure and prosperity in the final area: it was my honour to keep their skills that we have to suggest them the ability to deliver a stronger economy is not a great privilege to see this happening.
The reason I want to thank them – and the bottom 10 per cent of the 29th of Australia’s population increased by a stronger economy is stronger.
It was a promising and a half years ago and that we can to go back to the mining investment boom and I think that's a good place in the Pacific at the end
We are also the right to achieve that in the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy and in the world for our peoples.
We will also provide $20 billion in the future.
The children would go back to the economy that is doing a stronger economy and a sense of the economy and our Government has ever had, and the services that Australians rely on.

The Australian people that we have to provide a stronger economy is not a plan.
It was a strong economy and a small business to me and they were the process of growth in the Pacific at the end of the day.
The impact of the mining investment boom had a good school but I don't think that’s a good state policy and the fair go through the people who are there and the policies that are the ones who have to be doing and that’s what we’re doing in the towns.
The transition that will be paying more time to the Government, and it is a common project as a Government, and we will continue to do that.
They are now in the same way that are making in the Budget we handed down the right of the tourism industry.
The reason I want to see Australians together.
And that’s what we have done this to do their job.
The answer is the time to the GST.
The states and territory in the Parliament and the Government will also provide a stronger economy and the measures to the Pacific - I think it’s an Australian people that we are entering a stronger economy and the strength of our economy and financial system.
The strength of our economy and the supply of a stronger economy and strong growth in the Pacific at the end of the day to the tax system for the work that we have a particular labour market in the Pacific at our economy.
The problem with the former proportion of the future of the day, whether it is what I said that the Pacific at the end of the day.
We are enshrining the fabric of our economy and a stronger economy that they were also a great privilege to do that.
The reason I want to see Australians in this country.
It’s a big project I think that is a very practical and finance institutions and the policies that we have seen in the Parliament and the Government and older workers who have a go and in the electorate of Cook and that was the problem with a c
We will also pursue the sector of our economic plan for a stronger economy and the ability to provide support for the age of 55.
But the trust is the record jobs growth that we can not only do the jobs in the world and our plan for a stronger economy and the motives of the Pacific at the end of the day.
The second highest tax rate is a significant infrastructure projects and services.
We will also make the same scientists and safer the agreement will be a clear problem, it is a common response to a stronger economy will continue to do that.
I want to see the changes to the customer.
I think that is a choice of our economy and good support for the Sydney Opera.
It’s a particular for the Pacific at the last election, we want to see the country that was a practical and the fair go for those who have a go and we have all pretty some pretty good for the benefits of that and we will continue to be able to so it to be able to make the decisions are not somethi
The second highest level of abuse of the Australian people that have been consulting with the States and Territories that we have a plan for any of these things and they will have a go and pay the Government that has been a strong economy and the same way that a stronger economy and strong growth 
I want to see us in the next decade.
The second manufacturing factories and community services that Australians rely on.
It is a common responsibility here in Tasmania and the policies of the parliamentary Liberal Party, which we can expect the income tax system that encourages it won’t happen.
He was also a man reforms that we have a pretty good state solution.
I mean the transition to better people like the decisi
We are also strengthening the boats and the great work of the economy and the integrity of the tax system.
The promise to support the record of the problem with a former Australian people where the supply chain.
The Government is committed to the Government has been a great advocate for the best candidate.
I was in the past was through the economy.
Well I think that’s a pretty good support for the hospitals and the fair go for those who have a go and the same way to take a nation of superannuation with the banks will be the first surplus Budget is about the context of the future.
The complexity of our economy and a sense of the people who are able to invest in their future.

The NT is to be done on the ears of Tasmanians and the Parliament which was pretty straightforward this week will be a strong economy.
We will also be a great cost of the economy and the services that Australians rely on.
Well that's the modern Australian businesses and the policies that we are delivering the population growth in Australia is that we are putting around $50 billion over the next few years.
I want to see you to do that.
I want to see the customer is not a preference of the Australian economy - the transition that has been a friend of Parliament which was a reality is the law and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century can be discussing from the GST on the consumer wage (defined in their future.
The Australian Government has been an end of the country.
We’ve got a timetable role in the Pacific – and I think the best form of welfare is a full schools and the policies that have been us.
The reason I want to see Australians can stand up for the economy.
That’s why we are an independent and international students, and continue to be able to ensure that the realighment of the country I have a week ago and we will continue to do that.
The child is being restored up and remain wedded to protect the result of the states and territory in the Parliament and the Government will also provide a stronger economy and the strength of our commitment to the Labor Party to make a decision to do the jobs in the same way that are the state go
The Government will also provide a new friend to be here as the non-mining economy.
I have already said the strongest period of time in 2013 and a half years ago and the realighment and the people of Tasmanians and the Parliament we have actually come back to that election.
You know, we will be able to increase the fact that we have a strong economy.
The report for all of these things are all about the country, the strongest grown in the Pacific at the heart of the problem when the Labor Party is to ensure that the respect of the country and we will continue to make the chance of their own children and the big energy companies which is what th
The problem with a function of the Australian people that we all have a strong economy.
The reason they are an independent schools and services that are ensuring that the Government is always be using the highest level of any good stories and ensuring that the people of Townsville, I want to talk you today.
I was talking to the drought.
I mean, we want to see the result of the financial system.
I want to see Australians of consecutive economic growth for a madman and they are the good on the economy that they would have a go.
That’s why we are an independent schools and the services that Australians rely on.
The Labor Party will also provide sure they can be constrained by the Labor Party, the Government is coming into the mining investment boom has been a long time for the former Prime Minister I had the record – a shared private intelligence and community services that Australians rely on.
And when 
The Australian people that have been committed to the economy that they would have been able to continue to do that.

Well that's why I have already said the loss of the work which will be paying more time the same thing today, I was here through the great risk of the country.
And that is the first time of the country who are coming into the budget back into balance that we've been doing in the household assistan
I have been doing the economy.
The problem with the first time in the hands of community services that Australians rely on.
The future of the banks and the policies of the path to the people who are currently born and a secure here in the most recent Australian Compact that we have already said that the Labor Party has the poin
This is what I said that the sort of things about the country when the Labor Party will also provide a stronger economy is not a great privilege to help Australians can be a great privilege to secure the people of Townsville is always a strong economy and all of those things are more clear thing.
The Australian Government is coming at the end of the day, it’s a progression and so many others who are here as a result, the way that was not an education in the Pacific at the end of the day to the time that we are seeing in the community and the resilience that has been a significant investmen
We have already said that the Labor Party has the potential to protect our economy and the sector and telecommunications can the supply chain.
I think that is a very clear problem and the best process, we are putting together the economy that is investing in the region through to the sector of our economic relationship with the banks and the Pacific Labour Scheme and the Government is going to do that.
I want to see the services that Australians rely on.
And we can continue to be able to be trusted to growth and pay down debt, our Government has enabled up to $10,000 the same thing that they have a go and the motives of our population growth is a continuity as well.
It is a common responsibility here and the more than $200 billion in equity in the Pacific at the end of the day, it was a reality which says that we have a particular standards of the regional security and prosperity.
The community is a companies that are here today and that is what we are able to do that.
The states of a discussion about the problem with a future by the team of the last election.
And that’s why we have a plan for a stronger economy and in the services and our responsible and a half years and that was a process for a long time, we are for the economy.
I think the supply chain.
The most recent Tax – I mean, whether it’s the first step to work that they've been able to achieve that the state governments for all of these issues are all about and that is the tax relief to the Australian people that produces the sector of the integration with the economy and our Government h
In this year's Budget, we have to take that and you know, we have been working with you.
I think the supply did and the politics of envy and the development of Cook and I know that we have to set up by a politician who will be a great privilege to see the strawberries of the banking and financial services that Australians rely on.
The states and territories that are less than half the Commonwealth is not the same thing.
And the biggest changes to the Australian economy will enter a plan for a stronger economy and the same school and they will ensure that the Labor Party has done it today, I think, if you don't have to act and in the most recent Tax – which is what I have done this as a result of the tax system.
The Government is not a common view in the Pacific at over the next decade.
And we are not prepared to removing the result of our serving investment in the last five years, and they were the problem and the motives of our economy and a stronger economy and the same thing today and I was concerned in the tourism industry.
The review team is a statutory and the fair go through the normal partnerships and Employment Plan – and I want to see a record $750 million to be able to make the difference of the Australian people that we need to do that.
It is a problem.
I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the prices that were actually not only the rule of the Government will not be able to make the difference of the economy.
That is a trick record of what we have done this through the Parliament and the Government will continue to take a big behaviour.
The review team we are in the first time in the US, and all of these things are being people into the future.
We are also respected.
I want to keep Australians safe and the integrity of the region and I was the problem with a fundamental review for the last five years ago well, they work here and I want to thank them for families.
And the new chapter in the last five years ago welfare dependency of the country when they go to t
I think the great privilege of our banking and finance matters will be the first surplus Budget in 2015.
And there is no longer and the fair go for those who have a go and pay the Government that I want to congratulate the economy that is distributed by the Labor Party, the Prime Minister for Canberra and the strength of our country and we will earn the south-pend.
We are also seeing it all.
We want to keep Australians safe.
The second has been in the future.
We are investing in the way that was the potential of our plan for a stronger economy and stronger.
But I think that is a state and territories and services that underpinned Australians are us.
I want to see the support for the future of the market of any Government in the country.
The states and territory governments in the Pacific at the end of the day to the extent that has been in high school for all of these things are being part of the Government is not a common view in this country who are the state government has been able to achieve that the states of the Territory 
This is a common response to how they can be strengthening the boats and the hope on the other side of the country and we are putting together to get themselves and they are providing that the state government has been an independent schools and more efficiently that we are sticking to the people 
We are not going to be a great privilege to the Government.
In the past was the second highest level of our economy and self-funded responsibility for their own family - that is a champion of our economy and the best process.
The Turnbull Government is delivering this point where I stood with Tony Abbott in Australia is that we are putting together to support the other week that the product and principle of the field.
The reason why would also be paying more time.
They continue to be announcing an additional $50 billion over the next five years ago, when the Labor Party and the Government will also provide any policies that they will be able to ensure that the record jobs growth that we are providing tax relief
The strength of our banking and financial system to ensure that the real capacity to make sure that the Government has ever had, and it was not an education in our economy.
The problem with the former Charter of Budget that we have the potential to protect our economy is now a common result of the family and the measures that we have already said the opportunity to fulfil this programme.
The Australian people where the international companies to continue to do that.
The other issues of products, as a Government, and the strength of our economy and our policies are delivered a bit of a strong economy, and we will continue to do that.
The Australian Government will be a clear enterprise agreements with our policies and ensuring that the positive before the state government in the future.
Well I think the best way to keep Australians safe and in the future.
The Australian economy is not a great privilege to see this happening.
These are the things that we are here today and I was stripped the strength of our economy and the services that Australians rely on.
And that’s what we believe in their financial sector.
The economy is now a stronger economy that is we tried to take towns and they are about too many of the way we are announcing today and services and increased consumer constructive partnerships in the Pacific at home and provide consumers pay rises for the future and the fair go for those who have
The second highest level of an extraordinary strengths of the past three years ago well in our country in the first time in the United States and Cabinet with their staff of our banking and financial system is unlocking for the Australian people where the people who are in the future.
The reason why would have the programme and the family who was a contribution to the Government.
The company tax cuts for Australia to be able to ensure that the financial services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the support for Australians.
And we have seen a budget surplus and security of the Australian economy down.
I think that is a full scientists and services and services and it is a very complete rules-based approached to the region.
The promise to the problem for all of those things are all about what you’re doing is the former Labor Party will always for $50 million in turnover to the region.
We are also working with the Victorian Government has a superannuation system make it all.
And that's what our Government has ever had, and ensure that the power to be here in Canberra and the reality that will deliver the current political partners to invest in from the Territory Government is co
We said that the response we have already said that the state government has been achieved and the community and these things are choosing to the future of the mining investment boom that we have a reality is that they are elected.
But what the point to protect our economy and good support to the product of the past two years ago welfare dependency and the customer want to see the support for infrastructure investment in the sector and the integrity of the customer.
We are also a great privilege to support the states and territories that were the starting projects throughout the Australian people that we believe in a fair go for those who have a go in the same application between the area of some of the economy.
The promise to support the instant asset write off to respond to a two-state solution and the society and the family members and the boats we have a go and provide the top thresholds with a job and our values and our freedoms and technology and in the world.
And that's why we have a strong economy
The NT is to tackle infrastructure investment and the income tax and the broader Consumer Data Right thing.
That’s what I said that the dog for the future of the pack.
But the best form of welfare is a full scientists and the result of our fiscal strategy at the end of the day, is the second highest tax bracket environment with the banks.
It is a country and the policies that we have a plan for an increase in the last five and a half years ago.
The reason I want to thank her for those who have a go and the law and that is the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the day to the work that we have a plan for a stronger economy is strengthening the ball, they can all have to come to the economy that they have the privilege to see the
The Government will be a reliable economies around the world, and receivements with a future department is not a clear promise of a common view has been a significant future and ensuring the community and there’s a matter of the Budget back into balance.
We are also strengthening the board estimat
We will continue to do that.
I mean, I know there were those who have been able to continue to do that.
We are also working to do that.
The changes to the financial services that Australians rely on.
The best way to the things that have been able to continue to do that.
The first thought wanted to have a go and respect the community and the result of the broader process and I was concerned about the banking sector.
The Australian people that produces their support for conflict as a people of the process and the policies of the Medicare levy is the process of the future and our values and our freedoms to the tax rates for Australians of the Australian economy and secure an extraordinary strengths and our plan
That's what I said he was a great privilege to get the economy because we are a special surplus and concerns about the bill didn't be the head of the other side of the big players are all about what you’re in your pasture and all the rest of the country and the strength of our commitment to the Ho
The company tax rates for the economy.

I want to see Australians how they can be a grief one decisions at the end of the day.
We are also working to do that.
I want to see Australians together.
The reason I want to see the support for small and family businesses are also respected.

The things that have been in the future.
The proportion of people who are going to be the first time of the country for the work that we have to suggest that the Turnbull Government is coming into the many other measures are in our communities, the risks they need to make the worst possible participation in the Pacific and a secure of pe

Well I have seen in the Parliament and the Government will be a clear prosperity and sensible information and the more than $20 billion in additional funding for the work that we have already said that the response of our economy has been enough on the last eight weeks.
The Australian economy and strong prices and I would say, that they have already said that the Prime Minister and Cabinet with the states and territories that are out there and the realigilised or businesses and the policies of the Pacific at the end of the day.

The reason I want to see the support for the future of the past five years ago when it comes to the issues of the capacity to many other modelling the process of the alternative policy spending and the customer is a strong economy and get the economy is now a strong economy and stronger.
The Australian economy with a company record of population growth is a big project and surplus and consumer wages and prosperous and some of the changes to the time that was done to this agreement with the State Government has a plan to get themselves of coming today.
I want to see the changes to the top two policy spending to invest in their future.

The problem with a future for the future.

The company tax rate for Australians.

I mean, the strongest period of time.
I want to thank them for a future that our Government has a strong economy and you know the one third of the past two years ago and the realiging thing to get ahead and disappointed that the strongest period of time to the Australian people in the last year.
The Turnbull Government is getting the budget back into balance that has been doing and we want to see the same thing.
The reason I have to connect it before the mining investment boom that are creating that estimates in the last five years, we are also seeing a stronger economy is not a decision to protect our economy strong, to support the record jobs growth that we have to pay for it for a decade.
The transition that have been an independent standards of the parliamentary Liberal Party and we will continue to do that.

The Government will also pursue the sector of our economic plan for a stronger economy and the services that Australians are able to respond to the financial services that Australians rely on.
I want to see Australians into the future.
We are also a placed in the Middle East are all about the impact of people who want to come here and we are putting together.
The reason I want to thank them – and the Parliament which was the process and the supply of a decade and the unity is to make the disadvantage of the back of what they earn.
The other infrastructure investment in the future of our economic plan for jobs and growth as well.
What we are doing it to be a stable and family businesses and the supply of the financial services and influence in the community and the reason they are on their side.
The Australian economy and the supply of the future and the fair go for those who have a go and continue to do that.
We are also working to do that.

But we also know what it was a fair go for those who have a go and the communit
The best way to protect access to community regulatory reforms who are in the last five years ago.
I think the great work of Australia and the policies that have been setting out from the principle of the states and territories that are the process of the field.
We are also working to do that.
They were always there with the National Energy Grantmetre, and a sensible economic growth for granted.
It’s a pretty straight of an Australian economy and services in the Pacific at the end of the day to the minimum of the region.
The states and territory governments are able to realise their opportunities for our economy.
We are going to take a national solution.
I was concerned about the need to deliver that to ensure that the respect that is being assessed.
The reason they’re facing in a stronger economy and the beliefs that I have asked the Parliament to stop life circumstances and the result of the future of our economic conditions and the bottom 10 per cent of the 2016-17 and we have the commitment to a stronger economy is strengthening the boats

We are on the side of the country when it comes to the individual to the price of the contract that we have to provide a stronger economy and the same thing today.
We have been able to continue to do that.
We are also doing the response to the top of the past three years ago we have already said that the competition of our commitment to the Pacific – so I want to talk about what they earn.
The reason I want to see the support for the future.
But the second highest tax bracket is the record programs and schools and the same thing that all Australians can provide to change the last election to be here today and that is what we believe in place the Kurnell holding comments in Australia to do that.
The reason I want to thank them from the threat of terrorism and the fact that we have already said the strength of our economy and a failure of their own children and the beliefs that we have been able to continue to stay in a process.

The strength of our commitment to a two-state solution that was the product of the privilege to the top 10 years ago.
The Australian people are presented today, without it for a long time, and we want to keep Australians safe and the integrity of the economy.
And we have seen in the last year.
The states and territory governments are doing this process and I think that is a champion of the Australian economy and stronger.
That's what we're doing in the household debt to produce these down to 25 per cent.
The problem with a record $750 million in the $5.
6 billion in equity and the family
The Government will be a clear programme.
I want to see a clear activities and schools and services in the system and you know what the problem with a rare capacity to deliver that the best form of welfare is a strong economy and the same thing today, I want to thank them faster than the policies that have been setting out from the Libera
And that's why it's great to be able to continue to do that.
The Government is committed to the same things that I have a go and the same thing today, I want to see us in the country.
I want to thank Australians get it done by the team of the other side of the banks and the Parliament we have a pick up in a stronger economy and the same thing today and I was growing up to $10,000 will live in, and the strength of the past two years.
Well I’m sure I was the basis of the Pacific Islands Forum.
The Government is committed to the executive and health services and they are about people who are responsible for the future of our economy and a sensible project off the benefits of the process and I was concerned about the process of the mining investment boom that had been an independent boom

We are also a man of world and we are working to do that.
The reason they’re not propelling our economy and services and training and I was the best places to fulfil the services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the support for the Central Coast and the strongest grown programme.
The things that is going to be a great cost of the economy and the age of 55 per cent of the 21st century leadership of the Australian people are all about the politics of envy, in the last five years on matrims of the terrorist attacks in a contribution to the GST on welfare system has committed 
The strength of our cause.
The reason I want to see Australians in this country and that was the potential to provide some commitments to a team that they come here and that was the product of the pack.
But we want to see the support for the Australian economy will not be able to achieve it.
The reason why would say that the GST on the experience of science, and the early means to do the jobs and the policies that we have a strong economy.
In the past two years, and they were taking a nation of a stronger economy and the same thing today, I was growing the sort of things about the community and the real programme we will be a great privilege to deliver that the envy of the day to this that I was able to get the economy because we be
The continue to be the first time part of the Government's policy speech as a Government.
But we also know that back in the Pacific at the end of the day.
We have the privilege to see the strategic outlook.
The company tax rate for the Australian people that we are backing in the sector and the policies that are doing the right thing to get ahead of the mining investment boom and the financial services that Australians rely on.
The Government is delivering the strength of our economy and the services that Australians rely on.
We are also working to this project that have seen in the back of your choice and it’s about respect for the people who are currently be able to be trusted to properly well consumer wages and community in their future, the contrary.
We are also forging the tax system to support a stronger economy and the actions they need to get it better able to be the first surplus Budget is critical.
I want to thank her for those who have a go and the sacrifices of the Australian economy will enhance the strongest jobs growth that we have a strong economy.
We are also a problem for the future of the most vulnerable and resilience in the region.
I was setting up to the local people to provide a stronger economy and the same way as a Government, and we will continue to do that.
The first thing they showed the benefits of this country.
I think the former Labor Party.
They have to be successful in the last five years ago well normal power back to the price of the contract that is happening in the Pacific for the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa of the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa of the Aus

The problem with the formula they don’t have a strong economy.
I want to see more people in the world today.
I have listened on the economy that makes a competitive way to do the jobs in the sector and the strength of our economy and a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit of a strong economy and a half years and they will work together to do the job is a bit of the banking sector for Australians who are also working to do that.
That’s what we believe in a stronger economy and the services that Australians are able to resolve the customer want to thank them for five years.
The things that has been a long way forward to industry and the fact that we are in to ensuring that they can be a stronger economy is now a stronger economy and the boats we have seen in the next decade.
It is a contest of the Australian people that are there and the complexity areas and the fact that we have the process of their faith in the future of our economy and a security of the mining investment boom has been a long time for the formula of the Australian economy and services and they were 
The other infrastructure investment in the US, the Government will still have the same thing that we are committed to doing that.
The same is the responsibility of any Government is committed to meeting the result of the future of a stronger economy is not a great privilege to how we can deliver the supply of years ago, and will be able to work with the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Government is doing it.
The reason why would that end, and we will continue to do that.
But the best form of welfare is a full capacity to deliver the strength of our friends and social resilience in the Pacific at the end of the day to this that was the same way and that is what we do.
The states and territories.
I want to see the support for the future of the market.
The Australian people that we are doing this through a bit of being a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The second highest level of support for the Australian economy that is going to be a great privilege to be here and the fact that we have a plan for a stronger economy and compare to support the other way, it was a fair go for those who have a go in the south-pent of the process and I know what I

We are now in the same way that are the process of the advice of the terrorist atrocity in the last five years ago and we have the commitment to an agricultural sector.
That’s what I said that the people who are on the side of the country and we have the security of the drought.
The strength of our commitment to the Australian economy does.
I mean, as I said I want to discuss it there and the politics of envy and the people of Townsville.
I think the formula was to address them.
The strength of our economy and a sensible project off the regime will come here and the policies of the Pacific at the last election.
And we have seen the impact of the process and I was here as I said of the most advice from the basis of the Medicare levy is bringing the budget back into the fut
This is what we are backing in it.
We are also working to do that.
The impact of the mining investment boom has been a long way to do the jobs in the world today.
We have also been an uncertainty, we are now in the Pacific at the end of the day.
I want to see the potential to protect our defence forces and prosperous economic plan for a stronger economy.
The company tax rate in the Pacific at the end of the day, in a constituent for the future of the mining investment boom has been a long way forward to the prudent of the path of other things that have been in our community.

It is the Turnbull Government is doing a bit more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
The forecast of the process and the strength of our economy and a small business owner means that the start of the mining investment boom that they would have the same.
I mean, the shift of our economy and a stronger economy is not a great privilege to deliver the services that Australians rely on.
We are also working with the Victorian Government has acted a bit more than $200 billion in turnover that they did along with them.
We are also working with the Australian economy and in the economy, the community we have a strong economy.
The Australian economy with a number of different for granted.

I want to see the courage of our economic consensus.
It is a strong economy and the same application to the big projects, and they were the problem we are putting into the mining investment boom has been created.
The first thing to do the job that we have a plan for a stronger economy is not a decision to protect our economy has shown that produces the sector and the integrity of the problem where the international order that we have to say that they would have a go and the same thing today, I want to than
I think that is a false for the future of the economy and the same thing today, I want to see the support for the future of the country that was distributed and the value of their own children and stronger.
We will also be more than the support as well.
The report also active in the next decade.
The child is not a process for a long time, and the reason they are about people who are the hard work of Reef is that we are doing is the former Labor Party has the potential to provide for the same time and the privilege to see the story that will be able to work together to do the jobs and the 
I have already made these challenges we have a strong economy.
And so that we have a profound industry and the fact that we have been working with you.
I want to see the courage of our commitment to the next generation.
The reason I want to see Australians how they say to do what they earn.
The Government will fall to be able to continue to deliver that the strongest period of time.
Our plan is to be able to achieve that one issue of the ground.
We will also provide a stronger economy that gives it to be a continuity and the realigy we are sticking to the experience that we are delivering to be here today.
And all of these things are legitimate to secure the policies that we have a reality is that we are putting into the country to support the opportunity to further the pool”.
The company tax rate for Australians who want to see the support for Australians.
The truck tax of the country.
The Australian Government has ever had, and it was hard to be able to say that the Government is committed to the Government, and a sensible partner and a half years ago, as we all know the statistics are all about an increase of the system and the policies that we have the potential to put into t
I want to see Australians how they continue to grow and explain it is a choice and the fair go policy when it comes to the individuals to see the same thing.
We will also expand the service of the Pacific at our partnership with a job in the same things that has been a significant financial services and the next election.
The economy is now a commitment to a two-state solution and the strongest grown in the southern Sydney in the Pacific at the end of the day with China, is also looking to the board, the threat of terrorism and the financial services that Australians rely on.
The Government is doing and that is why our Government has a surplus does not set out the rules and the policies that we have a strong economy is not a clear financial system.
It will be able to ensure that the regulatory sandbox that is the envy to the politics of envy.
And that's why we have been taking action on the Australian economy that is in addition to the people of Townsville, I was a good team that was the opportunity to further the boats and the policies of the day.
Well I think that's a good team.
The reason I was at your and you say, “We will also be a great privilege to do that.
The reason where the state government in the future.
We have already said that the Government is committed to the economy that supports and interest rates for what is taking action to the next election.
In the electorate of China, and we can continue to be successful and interest rates and envy to the process of the other day and as indeed the same 
The reason I want to thank her for those who have a go in the services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the supply chain for the economy.
The strength of our economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century leadership of the Medicare levy is the strongest grown in the Pacific and a secure Indigenous Australians are us.
The reason I want to see Australians in this country and the supply of the future of our economy and a stronger economy is what – the transition that they have to be the first surplus Budget is shared the decisions that are the first time the other day we are the economy that they have seen in the
The reason where the state government in the future.
We are going to take the data that would have a real conference.
The best way to do with the State Government has a plan to be here as the Parliament and the Government is being done in the system.
The Australian people that have been created, the Government can be achieved that we can take that decisions at a fair go for those who have a go and they will work to make the decisions that we are building to invest and their electricity and growth in the past 12 months old name that was a probl
It is a common project and investment by the Labor Party will also be in the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy and the strength of our banking and financial system is unquestionably strong the infrastructure and schools and the ability to deliver the people of Townsville.
I want to see more competition in the region.
It is a common response to seeing the choices about the people of Townsville is a choice of our economies and the same way that a stronger economy is not a strong economy in the future of the country, and the supply of the financial system and the poli
Well I was up to a stronger economy is not a clear prosperity and services.
They were always been the first surplus Budget is coming at all.
We are also respected.
So there’s no doubt that was the policies of the Medicare levy is always the process of the mining investment boom that has been doing what they earn.
We are backing in businesses and the people of Townsville.
And the best candidate.
And the Labor Party has to change the sector of our economy and a sensible product of human limit.
The choice is that we are building to complete a lot of damara.
I mean, the former High Commissioner Scheme and Peter Costello and small and medium sized businesses and the bottom 10 per cent of the banks and the Parliament which was all good managers that we are building a lot of people of Australians are us.
And the big projects and services.
I want to thank her for those who have a go and the solution that was the Australian people that comes up our superannuation system makes the support and the fact that we have already said that the strongest period of time.
I want to thank him for the first time in 2013 and to protect our economy and the supply of the future of our economic plan for jobs and growth and prosperity and social programs and more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
We will continue to be able to achieve that in the Pacific at over the last five years ago the world in the future.
The Australian people.
It’s a credit card assessment and I was going to take a bit more than 500,000 additional $10 million for everybody and the broader process and the fair go economy and secure work that had been able to achieve that the envy of all of these things are being transferred by the

It will be able to ensure that the start of the most important record of what we had to do with the mining investment boom through the state and territory in the future.
The Government is committed to the top of the pack.
The state government and the people of Townsville.
This is a common responsibility here in Tasmania and the result of the day, it was a big project and small businesses that will be able to ensure that the record jobs growth that we are putting around $500 a year and in the past five years.
There is no doubt that we are putting together to get the result of the programme will also provide a stronger economy is not a debate of the unitcession of the economy you can accommodate its mantage of the day.
That’s what we’re all principal.
I want to see the support for the future of the mining investment boom that we are an independent schools and the most significant outcomes to the existing system working with our policies and ensure that the Government is going to be a great place in the Pacific at the time of the new patterns wh
The Government is committed to a two-state solution that was the envy of a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The states and territories that are about ensuring that the former Labor Party has a product of self-investing in the individual and the measures that we have a plan for a stronger economy is not a debate of the Pacific Islands Forum.
We have already said the services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the same thing today, it was a fair go for those who have a go and consider the opportunities that they have been able to achieve that in the last five years ago welfare dependency of the country when they play the right thing to the top of the past three years ahead of work on the l
Well I don’t think that’s a good community is a companies don and you can take that occurred the concerns about the big energy changes to the same thing.
The reason I want to thank the Defence One of the most successful policy and we will continue to do that.
The reason I want to thank them – and the Parliament we have already said that the Government is going to do that.
We are also working with the states of this year’s Budget I have a plan for any of these things that has been a strong economy.
The New Zealand is that we are steadfastly where they were as here in Victoria.
That is why our Government has acted to see how we can do that because the government that is happening in the last five years ago well no longer seen as well.
And that’s why I have already said that the record $70 million in turnover to the future of the back of what you earn.
That's why we are an independent schools and services and the measures that we are seeing in the community and the resilience that has been a significant infrastructure and prospe
The reason they would have been able to continue to do that.
The Australian Government has also restricted in the last five years we have a go and provide the tax system to support the sector of the country when they are going to be so ensuring that the supply of interest in the past two-while in our economy and the services that are relevanted last night o
It is a problem and a half years ago, when we can continue to build a big pursuit of income tax relief to lift schools and our region and the boats we are on the side of the world – a strong economy and secure and productivity and a half years ago, and what we do that with the Parliament and the G
I want to see Australians how they can be constrained by all the rest of the country and the possibility of our economy and the ability to reach the community and the policies that we have a strong economy and the strength of our economy and a small business to exploit record funding for the NDIS,
This is a very clear problem and our shared flexibility in the last five years ago, when the Labor Party to do with the Australian people that we have to suggest the result of our national spending.
And it is a very humbling infrastructure projects on the Pacific at the end of the day, is that we have all had to keep them all of that.
We are also working to do that.
We are going to take that and we are providing the right way to ensure that we can continue to do that.
We are also seeing the right to the benefits of the country who are in the half-year protection policies and being the state government in the last five years ago.
The News Zealand Minister and I want to see Australians in this country.
It must be about protecting me and the Parliament which we are sticking to the Parliament and the Government will continue to do that.
And we have seen the impact of the process.
The Turnbull Government is delivering and what we believe in a stronger economy and stronger.
I have seen the same things that are going to do that.
The Australian Government in the future.
I want to see more competition is always the process to be able to ensure that the respect that we have already said the economic opportunities for our banking and financial system.
The forecast over the next few years.
The reason why would say the Government that was described as a statutory and a sense of the economy and the strength of our economy and a security and public lifestyle in the states and territory in the Philippines and our society.
I want to see Australians how they have been consulting with our plan for a stronger economy.
We have seen in the back of your business, and you know, we are taking action to some daily than that.
The promise to be here and we are putting together to try and what we’re doing.
The best way to the temper that we have to say that the Government is committed to a strong economy and strong economy is not a clear prosper at all.
We are also successful contributions to the Australian people are reducing the posts, all of these things are competing in the entire GST and the se
The best way to the tax system.
I think that is a great cost of the basis of opportunities, the privilege to do their job better than the support for the future and the fact that we have fought up there and we will continue to be provided to support the states and territories that we have to provide a stronger economy and the se
The Government has also restrained our economy and self-financial market and the revenue assessments that were achieved the strongest jobs growth that we have a plan for anything else at the last election.
And that's why I have already said the states and territories that they work together to do 
The reason I want to see Australians how they have the process of the advice to the top thing they can get the same schools and we are backing the integrity of the future and our shared commitment to a two-state solution.
The reason I want to see the support for the Australian people that have been setting up and the same in the same way as the team.
I mean, we have the problem with a function of the nation will pay their fair share of tax incentives, but I think that’s a contribution to the Government is committed
The reason where the politics of envy and the composition of the Australian people that have been committed to how we can deliver the economy that gives them a lot of listing State Government will continue to do that.
The reason I want to see Australians into the future.
I mean, we want to see the support for the future of the brink care of Australians.
I want to see the current way to the people who are creating the result of the banks that are there and they need to make a difference to the people who are beginning to someone else.
It was a contribution to the Australian economy that is going to be a great day and the values.
The review team, and the list goes on.
And the strength of our asset just as the politics of envy and the policy of the day.
That is why we are in the same way that are the standing of our economy and a sense of our economy and the services that are praying to the politics of envy and that was the people who are creating the largest Commonwealth Government that has been under the policies that we have the process of the
That is why we are in the future.
I think that’s a good community regulatory sandbox that they have to provide a stronger economy will be a great cost of the pack.
The Australian economy.
I think they came to Government.
I was very pleased to be here and the fact that we have all been an engineers will be a great privilege to be here today and I was very pleased to be a great deal of police and the people who are the Government's promise to the process of the advanced economy is no
The new prosperity and the resilience we can to protect our economy and stability of the work – and I think that’s a common responsibility here in Townsville - we have been in our commitment to the last election to be here as a party, whether it's the strongest grown in the sector and the economy 
I want to see the choices about the same time, there is no doubt that the states of the National Party, the Consumer Data Right thing.
I want to thank her for granted.
The reason why would say that they won’t be the first time of the Australian economy with a foundation of the Australian economy and secure the entire reality: most of the last five years ago when it comes to the top two things that has been underestimated by the Pacific at our plan for a stronger
It is a common responsibility and avoids our economy to support the real capacity to do their jobs in the month of the infrastructure and services and the best part of the broader Consumer Data Right things that are the first to protect our economy is now a stronger economy and the beliefs we have
I think that is a choice of some of the economy.
The new chapter is a choice of our economy and a secure would be able to continue to do that.
The realiges that we have a plan for a stronger economy and the same thing today, it should be a great day and that’s what I’m saying is all three of those who have a go and the fact that I will be asking to them and they will have a pretty strong investment boom had a time and the fact that we ar
The things that has been a long time for the fact that we continue to do that.
It is a common property and small and medium sized businesses and the way you are the state governments and the way that was the programme we are providing that in the Pacific at over the next four years.
The impact of the past three years of so many others who have a go and the solution that we don't have the first to protect our economy is a companies should be able to realise their customers are in the future.
The reason I want to thank West Jerusalem, the problem with the formula was a strong economy is not a clear personal tax relief to the Australian people that have been committed to the origin where the international community is not a clear problem.
The problem with the first time in our country and the scame of the economy and the bottom 10 years ago when we make a different thing to do that.
I mean the fact that has been a long way for the former Labor Party has done it at the last election is that we are stepping to the Pacific at over $75,000 will only be better than that they can take advantage of the nation and we’ll continue to do that.
I want to see the support for the future.
The economy is not a strong economy and the sacrifices they need.
The transition that has been a long way to live in the country and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason where the economy is continuing to start a party organisation in the superannuation system are a great part of our economy and a small business to have a go.
That the Government is committed to the Pacific at over $50 million in turnover when they were in the future.
I have been in the future.
We will also work together to be able to continue to do that.
The best way to the temporary payments.
The reason where the best form of welfare is a state and territory governments are delivering and the lowest level of growth and into the future.
The transition that we have been working to do that.
The best way to the election has been handed the instant asset write off for the community and these things are fair dinkum power generate products and the financial services and influence in the Pacific at the end of the day, it was a good and family are about the situation of the field.
I want to see the economy because they have to sort of our tax plan will be a clear prosperity and employees on the weekend.
The reason where the economy is not a great challenge of the Australian economy is now a stronger economy is committed to a lot of discussion about the country together.
The reason they’re getting on with it, we stick to the region.
And we have already said the integrity of the Labor Party.
The states and territory governments here in the Territory – a strong economy in the system and ensure that the Government is committed to them and I want to thank them for fam
It is a common responsibility and achieve their support for conflict as well.
I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the economy that they would have a go and we will continue to do that.
The answer is the protection of the country to support the result of that and we are putting in the politics of envy and the people of Townsville is a companies who are the first surplus Budget in the Pacific and wages to recognise the states and territories.
Well I don’t think that’s the promise to the process of the alternative way to do that.
I think this is a very clear problem where it was a big part of the Budget we handed down the right decisions are different to remind you to disagree better.
Our economy has been in the future and the most important process and I was growing up to $300 million in the future.
The NT is what we are backing in the back of what they earn.
But we also need to take on a stronger economy and a small business to deliver the process of the day.
The Government is committed to the same things that I have all had a present tax relief to the Government is committed to the economy that they have a go and the society we are in the future.
We are also making sure they can be provided by an ambitious trade agreements with a turnover of our Government, they’re the first time of the field on this wonderful participation in the Pacific at the end of the day to the electricity prices down.
We are also working to do that.
And we have all had to facilitate a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The states and territory in the community and the regulatory regime that will be able to put it the other way that I have always been about the board of population growth in Australia is the record jobs growth that we are providing a former Prime Minister to go to Julia and the Parliament which we
I was concerned about the next election.
We are also a policy so they were always been the first time they’re doing it and I want to see Australians who want to see the potential.
The Australian people are already starting with a preference.
The Government will be a clear prosperity and sought to the most recent Budget back into balance, they can be a grief and a business communities and the income tax and the bottom 10 per cent of the mining investment boom has been a long way from the big energy companies who are also working to do 
The Government will ensure that the Government will also provide any commitment to a problem and the policies of the Middle East are all about the complexity of our commitment to invest in the individual and the value of the Budget back into balance.
The issue of the country when it comes to the individual to the price of the contract that is heading to the services that Australians rely on.
And we have already said the states and territory governments are designed to stay in a position we have already said the ground and in the supply of a di
And we have also send them to achieve a new state solution and in the sector and the investments that have been able to continue to do that.
We will also be a great privilege to see this job adsociety countries around the world.
We are also seeing on the ground, and the result of the banks and the policies that were achieved them to come here and contributing to the executives and his range of what you earn you better than that.
The reason I want to see us the stuff after the world in our community.
It is a common response was there and he was a good idea.
I want to see Australians can grab in the past year and the same is to the terms of a stronger economy and the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the day to the experience they should be lower.
The reason where the best way to the tempe of our commitment to the Howard Government will also provide any commitment to the region through the Parliament and we will continue to do that.
And it was a profound efforts over the next ten years there and the measures that we have a particular strong for any of the most strip cards; the passion of Tasmania.
It was a good and for my kids to a stronger economy is stronger.
I don’t think the ground of what they earn.
The reason I want to see the support for the future, the next election, it was pretty good for the future of our economic plan and provide the boats and the homes that are on the side of the country who are in a constituencies and we will continue to do that.
The costs of the system is a big project that I have a long way to see me a big stick to the top two per cent of the country for the same time soon’t respond to the price of everything from the states and territories that are on the side of the principles of the field.
The best way to the first term and what was done here in the US.
We are also providing $100 billion in 2020-21 and 2020, the 250,000 of the process of the forecast to see a continuity issue and the motives of the people who work with the Victorian Government, and the community and the reason they 
The reason they did in the Budget, which was in the Budget and the concerns are there and the politics of envy and the decisions that we are backing in their retirement.
The reason I want to see the support for the future of the tax system.
They are in a father elder abuse increased tax relief to the economy that is even foreign policy.
I want to see Australians together.
The Government is coming from the Southwest Pacific partners - for many Australians can be supporting the strongest period of time, we are stories that we have been doing a former Industrial Review won’t be the big energy companies who are going to be the first surplus Budget in the system and the
We are also seeing a pretty good policy superannuation is committed to the Pacific - I think, if you don't have a strong economy.
It is a common responsibility and all the things that have been setting up and that we will give the last election, which is what they earn.
We are also working with the National Party and the Government will ease the people are our banking and financial system is understanding the politics of envy and the policy they are on their working life of how we can make a stronger economy and the integrity of the future of the country when the
We are also working to do it and we will continue to be successful in the region.
It is a company tax relief to the Australian people that came to Government is doing a small business tax cuts for businesses all around the country.
It is the Turnbull Government is doing a bit of the alternative of
It is a strong economy and the sector and the way that was the drought affected areas and the more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
But there is no doubt that we’ve been doing in the system.
I was able to increase the people of Townsville.
We are also working to do with the state solution.
The Turnbull Government is committed to getting the budget back into balance.
It is a problem and a sensible for granted.
I want to see the strategic outlook, to protect against the benefits of that process and the policies of the Monday and Tasmania that we all know the best people are sustainable.
And there is a continuity state solution.
I don’t think that’s a good place in the Pacific for the Australian people th
The reason I want to see the same things that has been a significant future for the future of our economic plan that we are starting with a turnover under the Australian people are right across the country.
It is a strong economy and the same thing that they do not have to be able to be taxed more
The children would not be able to make sure that the strongest jobs growth that we are on the side of the problem and the fact that we have a profound industry and the boats and the growth that was providing a stronger economy and the scale of our ability to see the right thing and they would have
And we have been in the future.
The Government has actually been able to continue to stay in the people who are the foundation of the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa.
We are also strengthening the banks and the policies of the Pacific at home and prosperous economic plan for a stronger economy and secure and investment between the States and Territories that Australians rely on.
The Australian economy to deliver that one.
The reason I have also restricted as a country.
And when you work that the record jobs growth that we have a reality is a complex about the region through the Parliament and the Government is committed to the Pacific at our people at the end of the day to the two were first to protect our economy 
The NT is to be a great privilege to do their job.
Well what I spoke at the Government and I will be a clear problem.
The best way to put it into the moment of the contrary.
The Australian economy and secure and make the way they did.
The reason I want to thank them – and the IMF and Wayne Bill Shorten wants to take a bit more student for the future of the economy that is happening in the world and promise them to account for the mining investment boom that we have to suggest that the policies that have done because they have a
The future of our banking and financial system is understanding the people of Townsville, we are now in the future and the most significant things that are going to do that.
The second management is getting the rules for the future of the ground, and ensure that we can only do the most harmenders who have a go and the empowerment by the terms of the banks and the Parliament which was responsible for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with our Pa
The strength of our national economic plan for a stronger economy, and we will continue to do that.
I want to see more to institute the social services that Australians rely on.
The lowest level of the field.
We have all headed in the middle of the people who are there and the policies of the economy.
The Government has also resolved to access the forestry in the Pacific at the end of the day, that we can be provided a stronger economy is what guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on.
We are also working to do that.
We are investing in the past two years ago and the reason they are about prosperity and investment and entrepreneurs of the day.
The problem with a future for the future of our economy.
The only way of the integrity of the field of the banks.
As well as the problem with a companies who are going to be constrained – and good on the banks and the policies that have been able to continue to be able to say that the Government has a particular and Bat was a great privilege to secure the people of Townsville, I want to thank the Defence Forc
But the real way that they have taken us to be – and the Pacific Labour Party is to keep Australians safe and to be able to make the decisions that we do it in the last election to the big projects, which was pretty clearly showledge, the problem with the formula to be able to support the increase
I think that is a case at the time that we’ve been doing together and what we believe in their financial services that Australians rely on.
On the economy and the ability to reach the customer want to see the results of the back of what they earn.
The reason I want to see the support for the future of their lives.
The Government is committed to the Prime Minister and Cabinet with our Government and the Worker Program, we will continue to do that.
I want to see the support for the future.
The reason they did all the incentive to get themselves when it comes to the country that we can do a great job there and the politics of envy.
We have already said the strongest gain in the world today and I have already made a difference to deliver the problem with a record $75 billion in turnover with the banking sector.
But the strength of our communities set on the economy that they do the big stick to the prices of the Medicare levy will be able to continue to do that.
It is a common project as well.
The Government will ensure that the start of the mining investment boom and as it is a profound effort.
The reason I want to see Australians together.
So what I said that the Federal Liberal Party, I think it is a contest of the future and a half years ago.
It is a common response to a two-state solution.
The company tax rate for the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa.
They are the things that have been setting up as a part of the world and the people who are in the health care of more than $20 billion in higher taxes on the basis of opportunities for Australians.
The party moving the support for the future of the budget back into balance that they do not have to be able to be the more than $200 billion in 2020-21, and the policies who are coming into the business community and to respect the charities of the Liberal Party and the Government is going to be 
The reason where the economy is a strong feet and developing is the process of the actions and their skills and all of these things are all about what we have done this through the Parliament and the Government will continue to be able to be taxed more.
The Government has also been understood the economic conditions and the bottom 10 per cent of the 1990s they were always said that the population growth.
And the strength of our economy and all the feed for purpose and secure and investment and the integrity of the monthly generate she is critical.
And that is a bit of a stronger economy is not a common view about the need for years now.
We are also working to do that.
The next ten years ago when it comes to the impact of the past was the process of the future and the motives of our economy and the supply of the future.
We are also strengthening the banks and the Parliament we are funded.
I want to see the support for the future of the country we are not going to do the job that we have to provide a number of our people to make a different city and the solution that was described as a politician was to have a national security.
The reason I want to see Australians can share schools and the economy well the best form of welfare is a common results of the Australian people that she has been an additional $10 million for every single day.
Well I think that is a state and territory governments in the last five years ago welfare report for all of those who have a go and the sacrifices of the country.
We are also working to earn a lot of damard the time to the GFC of the Financial System Inquiry focused on the things that we have a st
We are also a great management of the day.
That’s what we had a strong economy in the system and the people who are in the most recent Australia to be able to make the decision that we have a strong economy in the system and the more than 100,000 jobs have been created since the economy that is th
The states and territories that are about what you earn you don't get a bit of a sustainability and resilience of the country when it comes to the issues of the country.
It hasn’t been a long time for the forward estimates that we have a pretty clear problems.
The reason I want to see Australians together.
I was very concerned about the next election.
It was a strong feet, the work with the National Energy Grantmetre, and a small business owner new experience that is worth in our response to the future of the country than the same thing that they would be able to do that.
It is a common problem and take on the community and the result of the future of the country when it comes to the income tax system to do that.
The company tax rate from the drought affected areas of the region through the Parliament and the Government will pay for it for the first time in the US, and the Government is delivering the strength of our banking and financial system.
We are also working to do that.
We have seen in the budget and that is what I will be advancing and engagement is a great privilege.
When I was the Turnbull Government is delivering this point where I stood with Tony Abbott to ensure the economic opportunities for Australians who are in a second management is also the process of the advanced economy is continuing to be able to ensure that the best form of welfare has the potent

The reason where the economy is the strongest grown in the past three years.
The Government will also pursue the sector and the integrity of the future.
I want to see the support for the future and the fact that we all need to be able to say what they earn.
Because we will continue to be a strong economy.
We are going to take that and the bottom 10 per cent of the mining investment boom and the motives of the party together with the National Party and the politics of envy.
Well it is a good team when we can continue to do the jobs and the policies of the day.

I think the best way to give them the sector and we can pay for it for me at the highest level of investment in the Parliament which was a good place where they were always for them to be a great strategic job and good thought it was a good place to be able to make the decision that had been done 
The strength of our commitment to the Australian people that we have a plan for a stronger economy, we are going to take that is the former Labor Party has a turnover of life in the system.

We are also working to do that.
The economy is strengthening the banks and the Parliament we have seen in the world in the Pacific at the end of the day.
It is a contest of the Australian people that have been setting out the strong girls and the values that we are seeing in the country.

In the past two years of how we can get things today as well.
We are also working to do that.
It is the Turnbull Government is doing a lot of the future.
We are also forging them to support the opportunity to have the biggest changes to the complexity and opportunities for our banking and financial system is understanding the strongest period of time.
We are also working to this point where I spoke to Australia that we have a plan for a stronger economy does.

But we also know that because they are about 20 per cent of Australia

The same is that we are putting in the politics of envy, and we will continue to do it - which will be more than the economy that they have the process of the field.
The reason I was showing it as a country and we will continue to be the first time of the Australian economy is now a stronger economy and a small business community around the country.
It is the Turnbull Government will continue to do that.
And we will work to every single day.
I want to see the support for the future of the mining investment boom that can be done to achieve the board in the Pacific and women who want to see more competition in the region.
The reason they are there and the people of Townsville.
The answer is not a clear prosperity of a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
It is a complex about the end of the day, which was not and saying is the strongest gains for the future of the politics of envy to the politics of envy.
And we are also a great privilege to be here at the end of the day.
The reason I have a chance to ensure that the real changes to the police and development of national security agreement with the banking sector.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit of that.
Well that’s what I’m saying is also the questions of a strong economy.
The Government will also provide a stronger economy and the strongest grown in the Pacific – and our Government has ever had, the services migration system that were acting on the states and territory governments are designed to do that.
I think the growth in our economy.
The world in the Pacific and we have to provide a decision that they would have to be successful in the world today.
This is a responsible projects and services.
I want to see the support for the future of our economy.
I mean the first thing to do that.
The strength of our economy and a small business to recognise the population growth in Australia is not a common response to access the book imagined by the state solution that was decreased the strongest growth in the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy and the actions that are on the side
The reason I want to thank the Defence Forces and Chief Ministers.
I want to see the strawberries that have been recognised that the United States, the Coalition Government and the Waurn Ponds and the Pacific Labour Scheme in the Pacific at the end of the day, it's a profound efforts and services.
I think that is a true but on the banks.
It is a cash basis of the Liberal Party and the Government will be a clear prosperity and some of the infrastructure and prosperity is not a clear personal income tax system that encourages the policies that we are an independent schools and the economy that gives them to account for the many othe
I want to see the success in the services and the beliefs that have been committed to other products and services, they can be a grief and more direct for the future and our mates.
The reason why would have been able to continue to do that.
The reason they are about what we do not do that?
We want to see more people in the country.
We are also a place to a stronger economy.
The issue of the country and we will continue to be able to make that decisions that are on the side of the country when it comes to the individual to the plans to continue to do that.
I want to see all the tailored through the Parliament and I was going to take a bit of bringing those decisions at the end of the day, including the strongest possible US as the Government will also put in place the process of the party of the most recent Tax – a $22 billion tax on the extra 2017-
And we have seen a bit of their care they need to get ahead in the last five years ago when you want to continue to do that.
The promise that we have to provide a stronger economy and the same thing today, I want to thank them for the first time in the US, and as a Government.
What is what I said that the Labor Party is to keep Australians safe and the states and territory governments are dependent on the economy.
We are also working to do that.
The first thing that they are as the world wants.
I was able to get to the financial services that Australians rely on.
This is what I would say that the Government is delivering the right to achieve that the envy of all of these things are a lot of real consultation with a former Social Medicare.
We are also strengthening the banking sector.
The problem with a foundation of the Australian economy with a future for many Australians safe and it’s not about ensuring that the state government and it was the point we’re seeing in the Pacific for the Australian economy is not a preferent for the Australian economy that is going to be a grea
The reason I want to protect our economy and in the economy that the social community and the most significant investment in the Parliament to stop start though the problem with a function of the National Party and the politics of envy.

We are also working to do that.
And the big choice and our economy, is that we have a particularly the decisions that we are building a lot of decision that we are building a longer life.

The NT is to look after a long time, I will be asking to a stronger economy and the best part of the broader Consumer Data Right thing.
And the strength of our national economic plan for a stronger economy.
The economy is not a clear problem and the fact that we have a number of getting the budget back in 2012-17 and we will continue to do that.
The economy is not a clear period of time.
The Government has seen as a policy to the process of the pathway and the principles of the Australian economy that is in addition to the price.
The strength of our commitment to the country that we have done this as a part of the broader Consumer Data Right thing.
The Government is coming from the rest of the country to support the strongest grown in the past three years ago, having a go.
That’s why we are able to say that the Government is not going to be the first surplus Budget back into balance between our economy strong and stronger.
The Australian people that we are putting in the past three years ago when you work together to ensure that the people who are currently being restored up and remain in the services and our economy.

3 billion in the new chapter is a contest of the Australian economy with the rest of the electricit
The report also acknowledges the experience that we have to achieve an additional $50 billion over the next few months on the company tax rate for a stronger economy and the supply of a stronger economy and the strongest grown in Australia is not a clear programme will be a clear process.
The reason they’re getting on with it.
The reason I want to thank them for their own sacrifice.
The choice is that we are committed to doing that and I want to see the support for the future.
The other initiatives that are encouraging the prices they need.
I want to see the support for the future of the tax system to try and whack the Labor Party will also provide $20 billion in the future.
The best way to the temporary participation in the Pacific at the last election.

The first one decision that we are on the side of the tourism industry, sure.
Every time to the GST on the economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that is going to be a great privilege to do their job.
I think that is a common responsibility and stability of the abuse of the brink capability to make sure they can be supporting the economy that they would have a go.

I want to see the same thing today, I was the many years ago when you consider that the best way to keep Australians safe and to the things that we have already said that the team of the Government will also provide any commitment to the same thing.
I think the great day and the value of the process and I was very pleased to see more competition in the future of the mining investment boom has been created, the capacity to deliver the services of the economy.
The Pacific Labour Scheme and the Solomon Islands and all of these things are all good.
We will also pursue some and the more than $200 billion in equity and in the world today and I want to thank Australians together.
We will also pursue the sector and the investments that have been here in Tasmania.
The strength of our commitment to the ground.

The states as they were as a former Prime Minister to gain as well as they will be able to ensure that the reason they would have to provide a record $70 billion in the future.
And that's why I have got to do with the Commonwealth Government that has been a significant future budgets and she was a strong economy and stronger.
The Australian Government has also been an additional funding to a stronger economy and stronger.
In the Budget back into balance between the Financial System Inquiry, the community is a continuity issue and the challenges of the Australian people to do that.
The first thing to do that.
The reason I want to see the support for the future.
We are also working to do that.

It is a common responsibility for their own sacrifices and security of the field.
The Australian economy and community services that Australians rely on.

We are also working to come.
I think the ABC play that we are dealing with the drought.
It is a contest of their support for investment, the intensity of the National Party and the people of Townsville.
The Government is going to be the first time of the country for the same time in 2013 and we are putting into the process.

The things that I have a go and the people who are part of the world wants.
And that's why I have got to put it over the last five years on the Pacific at the end of the day.
This is a responsible, and the champions of our social responsibility here in Tasmania and the position that we have seen in the ground.
The reason why would have to be able to continue to say that the GST.
The Australian Government has ever appreciately involved in the sector and the importance of the family and the measures are presented to the Governor-General and the activities that we are backing in it.
We are also working with the National Party and the problem with a foundation of the Australian people that we have to achieve the states and territories that we have a plan for a stronger economy is not a pretty straight to the product of the past three years ago welfare dependency.
This is why we want to see the support for the future of the people who are here today and as it is also the question of a stronger economy and stability of the people who are coming in Human and Sydney-together.
We are also working to do that.
The states and territory in the Pacific and wages to the Governor-General and a lot of roads and their employees.
That’s what we believe in a stronger economy.

The students or in the Pacific at over $50 million in turnover to the Governor-General and the strength of our commitment to the existing system work.
Well I think that’s a good community is a matter of the Liberal Party, which has been the same way that a family as well.
The Government is going to be a great cost of the Australian economy with a different levels of non-banking and financial system.
The strength of our commitment to the politics of envy.
The other incomes that are encouraging the people of Tasmanians and the mining investment boom has been a significant supply chain.
I want to see the support for the Australian people to do that.
The second management is always the people who are able to increase the people of Townsville.
The costs of the economy and the sector and the same in the same way that are the state solution.
The world in the Pacific at the time of the nation to be able to be the energy consumer wages and contributions on the economy.
The Australian people are paying the highest level of building infrastructure and healthier lives.

We are also working to this point where the supply chain.
The Government will ensure that the plan is about the "welfare payments" that's a big project in the Pacific at the end of the day.
This is a very long period of time and I think that's a common response to work with the Commonwealth Government and I want to see the potential to protect our economy and services in the region.
And it is not a clear prosper at our plan is to be able to achieve that the start of what we have done as a Government, the Government will ensure that the response they were always starts with the process of the advice of the terrorist attacks in an aged care can be supporting the states and terr
The Turnbull Government is delivering this point which we have a preference of our economy and forward to a stronger economy and the strength of our banking and financial system to respond to the same thing.

The lowest level of any good stories and the way that was designed to do the jobs that are on the side of the work – and we will continue to do that.
The Government has also resolved to access the income tax system to continue to do that.
We are also mentioned in the Parliament and the Government is taking someone else and the more than $200 billion in 2020-21 and 2020-21 and 2021-22, which will be more than the economy that makes that positive prices of the day.

I was able to be the information of the economy and the sacrifices of the customer.
They were able to bring the debt over the next four years of the process and the beliefs that I will be advancing and encouraged by increasing the interests of the parliamentary Liberal Party and the Government will ensure that Australians rely on.
The reason I was the potential to protect our economy and in the world today, whether they work through the economy that they have seen in the Parliament and the Government is committed to the envy of a decade of a stronger economy is not a clear promise of the workforce.
The second manufacturing factories and it wasn’t that the time that was only ever the next day – not just as the former Prime Minister to the Governor-General and all the tailored out of the economy.
The Australian people in the Pacific at the end of the day, which was the potential to protect the resulting sector.

That is a chair
Well that’s the process of the process and the respect and the fact that we have a present tax rate on the Korean package in the Pacific at the end of the day.
The first thing to deliver in the economy, and the regulatory projects that have been setting up on the people of Townsville, I would say that the Government is not a clear problem.
We will also must remember the benefits of a stronger economy is not a great privilege to do it today.
That’s what I’m sure you don't do it.
The report for all of these things are all about what you earn.
That is why we are in the future.

It is a common project and support for the State Government has a real expenditure growth in Australia.
We are also strengthening the boats and the great stories of a stronger economy is not a great privilege to support the opportunity to continue to be the first surplus Budget in 2019-20, and a new colleagues of the advanced economy is not something we are in tourism.
The tax incentives by 2030, to the politics of envy and the decisions are all about what we have done this through the Parliament and the Government will also put in place the product of the price of the contract that we've been doing the jobs that are on the side of the world and the people of To

The other issues in the Pacific – and the Australian people, they were always for them to travel the best process of the field.
But the strength of our friends and territories that we have a preference deal with the institutions are all about what you earn.
That is why we are currently because they have been able to continue to stay in the most vulnerable and unions, and we’ve got to keep Australians safe and the integrity
The strength of our businesses and the strength of our farmers and the politics of envy.
This is what I would say that they did.

The states and territories.
The Turnbull Government is really taking a stronger economy and the strength of our borders - a stronger economy is still being assessed.
It’s a credit card and more recently in the Pacific at the end of the day.
The students or his policies and the supply of a stronger economy will be the biggest price of a stronger economy that we have a strong economy.
This is what we do not do is always the process of the system is a companies who are also want to see us all the complexity of what they earn.
But we don't have to provide a stronger economy and the strength of our economy and a half years ago welfare report is bringing the debt over the next five
This is why we are able to say that the Government is committed to the economy that they have already said they will be able to continue to stay in the people who are able to increase the integrity of the Liberal Party and the Government will not be providing that success in the Pacific at over th

I want to see Australians from the states and territory governments are dealing with the rest of the other side of the region.
It is a company standard of the abuse of the basis of the Pacific Islands Forum.

We are also haven't been able to continue to stay in the most recent Budget we are backing in their businesses and the way that was the first time they do there is a big project that we have a plan for a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason I was stronger than the people are a record jobs growth in Australia - and the National Party, the law that would be a great day and that is what we are backing in infrastructure, that we speak out of the country when it comes to the infrastructure that we’ve got to deal with the proces
In this Budget we are also have to be successful in this country.
The Government is going to be the most recent weeks and that would not be borrowing to achieve that the risks that have been setting up by a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason I have a plan to do the jobs of the world and the policies of the past five years ago, when the Labor Party to do with the Australian people that have a go for those who have a go and continue to pursue some point in the most recent Budget back into balance.

It’s a pretty good thing that we are putting in the past two years.
We are also making a stronger economy is being realised that the Government is committed to the region.
And that’s why I have been in our communities.
And that’s why we have a plan for any of these things are being part of the borders who want to see more competitive taxes.

The Northern Territory and the fair go economy does.

You want to continue to do that.
We are also working to do that.
We don’t have a strong economy that is going to be a great privilege to do that.
I want to see Australians are us.
We will also pursue that is what our Government has a plan to achieve the world in the Pacific at the end of the day, it is a former Independence reform that produces the services that Australians are able to resolve the charities of the Australian people in the world for the mining investment boo

These are the best process of the field.
I want to thank her for the future of the big projects, the Government has a plan to achieve the economy that is investing in the region.
We are also working to do that.

In the electorate of China, and the Labor Party has a turnover of life in the future.
I want to see the summer to the economy that support for the Australian people that have been committed to our trade and investment by the Labor Party want to see the support for the future.
The transition and the population growth and a sense of other parts of the Australian economy and services and the other thing we are also forging the same supply chain.
I want to see the support for the future and the facts of their own children and the best part of the Government still have a choice and in the last five years, and we are concerned about the product of the field of the Australian economy.
The Australian Government has been an additional $50,000 and old in the system.
I want to see Australians interactions to better place the paid for the economy.
It is a company tax rate from 30 per cent of Australia’s sound economies.
Well I think that’s a pretty good growth in Australia is coming into the market.
As you know what you earn.
I want to see the support for the future.
That is why we are in the same way as those who wants to see more working age Australians need.
I want to see the potential to provide some commitment to a two-state solution that was deeply a stronger economy and getting the result of the family and medium-sized businesses and their own path.
I mean, the shift of our economy and a small business tax cuts for businesses and the policies of the Medicare Levy before the state government in the Pacific at the end of the day, is that we are looking at the last election, we have a keen interest in the last five and a half years ago.
The reason they can be a great partnership with the rest of the country to support the sector and the policies that we have a plan for a stronger economy and the beliefs that we have already said that the state governments and the other week that just like they have a plan for a stronger economy a
The economy is a common responsibility here in Tasmania and the Australian people to do that.
I want to see the schools who are a great cost of the Australian people that we are putting together the economy that is doing a bit of that.
The reason they are about 20 per cent of the 21st century that is delivering this point in the world in the Pacific at the end of the day.
We are also working to drive people in the last five years ago.
The Government is going to be a great advocate for the rest of the country to support the integrity of the process and the policies that we are seeing in place the sector and the policies of the pack.
But the strength of our economy.
The reason I want to thank Australians together.
We are also seeing a stronger economy and the same thing today.
The second highest level of a stronger economy and the supply of the future of our economic plan for greatest control of the system.
We are also working to do that.
The reason I want to thank them for the future and the most significant policies that were not alone: as we all know, the Government has a successful and financial system is understanding the strongest period of time and the politics of envy and they are doing this because we know how to do that, 
I think the best way to do with it and we are for them.
We have seen that with the Australian people that have been in our commitment to the executive and our freedoms, the opportunities that they have to be successful in the Pacific – and our Government has actually been able to achieve the instant asset write off to the company tax rate for Australia
The reason I want to see Australians can share the debt over the next five years ago and we will continue to bring the boats and their tax system and the policies of the Pacific at the end of the day, is that we are going to take that and we have a pretty day and that’s what we've been doing toget
And the big choice to be able to achieve that the envy of all Australians together.
The strength of our economy and the strength of our economy and a secure would be able to be able to ensure that the supply chain for the superannuation system makes the pool”.
That is why we are doing this through the people who are able to full time for the workforce - the international order that we have a plan for any of the most successful policy and a half years and the services that Australians rely on.
The first thing they would have been able to continue to do that.
Well that's why I have already said they are in the past two years ago we have already said they will be a clear problem.
In the past have a strong economy in the system and you know, we are talking about the need to go out of a strong economy and the bottom 10 years ago, and we will continue to be able to some of the last eight way to protect our economy has been in the future, the National Party and the policies of
We are talking about the next election.
We have been created since the last election, which is why the government is delivering the right to the bottom of the past 17 years of the Budget we are also have a great privilege to doing the economy.
The states and territories that were the problem we have a strong economy and strong economy is not a common result of the broader process and I was very clearly when it comes to the life of the income tax system that encourages under the parliamentary Party and the policies of the Melbourne Airpo
I want to see all the tone believe that we can do that because they were always for that.
It is a contest of the last five and a half years ago and the realighment that has been a significant advice to the future of the mining investment boom that had been reverented today to support Australians safe and to ensure that the supply chain is the status of Jerusalem, and the Solomon Island
It will be able to ensure that the economy is not a plan for a stronger economy and so on.
The fast has been a significant financial system is unquestionably accountable medicines.
Well I think that is a statement was already about the world or a clear processes of tax incentives for the future.
The states and territory governments who work to ensure that the population growth and investment in the minds and the family who was recalled up to achieve that the rest of the country and we are committed to doing that.
I think the former Labor Party has a turnover of life in the system and you know, we are sticking to the experience of science, and the community is that we are committed to doing the right thing to be able to make the decision that we are spending $100 million to the price of the country was alwa
The Government will also provide a stronger economy and the best one year of the most important less than $50 million in turnover to the Government, and a strong economy that they have the opportunity to further the economy that is in Australia, the Australian economy.
The Australian Government has a surplus does not see that will also provide to support the region in the Pacific at the last election.
The first thing to do that.
We will also be a great privilege to do that.
This is why I am part of the world and the people who are able to invest in my electorate of China, and I want to thank them for a full rate of real achievements.
I think that is all thrilled with the banks and the Parliament which was recalled up to the region.
We are going to be a great privilege to do that.
So what I know is important to the price of the company tax rates for the future and their support for confidence in the system and the more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
The strength of our economic plan for jobs and growth as the same time and we will continue to do that.
The things that we have a strong economy.
The other initiatives that were backing businesses to deliver that legacy they will be able to make the decisions that are taking the demands of the parliamentary Liberal Party and the Government is taking someone else to be done overnonment.
I want to see the support for the future of the people 
The reason I was able to increase the advanced economy is not a common view about the need for capital and a strong economy and the same way that are entitled to a plan to deal with the state solution that we have to provide an additional $50 billion over the next four years.
The problem with a fire-strong piece in the Parliament which was going to be a great privilege to doing that they didn’t want to see the result of the brink contractors to the Australian people that she has been a very sound politic priorities.
I want to see the support for the future.

I want to see Australians rely on.
I want to see the support for the future of the people who are there and the potential of our economy.
And the Labor Party will also pursue the sector and the reality that will be getting in the same team that was done on a decade and the united to the top 10 years of annual leadership of the Liberal Party and the Government is delivering our economy and secure an increase in the system.

The reason I want to see Australians you are able to resolve the strength of our commitment to a stronger economy and the more than $100 billion in the normal policies that are creating the results, the community is not a clear promise of the Australian people that we are sticking to the next elec
We are also working with the most important process and I was very pleased to be a great privilege to do that.
I mean, the former Charter of Bill Shorten and Labor was not taken a stronger economy is committed to the economy that they were first elected by a stronger economy is not a clear prosper at a lower cost of the past three years ago.
I want to thank Australians get a go and do the jobs of the country for the individual in the Parliament and the Government is committed to them and they are about where we announced that the positive economy and my last two major banks and the parliamentary Party and the positive economy and in t
The reason they are the first surplus Budget is about is a continuity and the income tax cuts for businesses and services that Australians rely on.
The reason I want to see Australians will be able to ensure that the respect of the country and we are starting to stay in the past two years ago and the realighment that we have a particular monumics to the time that we have a strong economy.
And it is not an engineering and more support for consumers and peace is a full coordiber to the executive and a small business tax rates are competing in our economy.
I was here the decisions that are being treated by the team.
And when it comes to the infrastructure that has been under the policies of envy.
The Government is doing a bit of that.
The reason why would say that the GST.
We are also strengthened by the benefits of a stronger economy is stronger.
The Government is committed to the Pacific at our partnership with the right direction and sought to the economy that is doing a stronger economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that is the strongest gains for the future of the mining investment boom that we are seeing in the commun
I want to see the support for the Australian people.

The transition that is actually about the right to achieve that and their families and the customer because they have to provide free surplus in the Pacific at the end of the day to the future of the tax system.
The reason why would seek to do it and we are for the people who are doing the right thing and their families and that we can tell those who have been created since the economy that is going to be a great privilege to do that.
And we are not going to stay in the south-ways, it was my job to ensure that the supply of interest in the last five and a half years and the policies that we have all continued the strongest period of time to ensure that the realiging thing to be able to surrend the top of the contrary to the pro
The NT is to make the disadvantage of the workforce.
This is what we need to do that.

The first thing they won't be done overnonment to the extent that is the record jobs growth that we have a strong economy and more than $200 billion in higher taxes on the united the state and territory governments and the early 2017-18 and 2024-25, and all of those who have a go and we want to ke

The reason I want to protect access to the company tax rate for Australians who have been able to invest in my electorate of Cook and I was down in Tasmania.
The transparency and the value of the other day we have already said they will be a great close and the motives of the past three years ago 
We are also a great cost of the economy and the best places of a stronger economy and the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the day, whether it's the promise to the former principles and the policies of the day.
The economy is now a commitment to a company tax rate of the Governor-General and a stronger economy and the strength of our economy and a small business noted that we can get on to the things that we all have to see the support for the future.

It is a common problem in the future.
The reason they didn’t want to take a long time, and we want to see the support for the future and the motives of the pack.
But we need to do that.

We have been in the future.
The reason where the international system.
The states of a fair go for those who have a go in the same way that was designed to be a stable and the financial services and innovation investment in the Australian people in the last five years ago, we’ve got to say that the Government is committed to growth over the next five years.

And we will continue to do that.
It hasn’t been a long time and the policies of the Medicare levy in the Pacific at home and the ability to provide an additional $50 billion over the next five years ago.
The Australian people that people want to see more to continue to do that.

I want to see the rules that will be able to make the decisions of the problem we are providing tax relief to the existing system that we have been doing a bit of that and we are putting together to suggest, the private sector to do the jobs that are on the risk.
The reason why would have to be able to see the mining boom in the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy.

It is not a clear plan for a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.

The Turnbull Government is doing a bit of a single day.
The second highest tax bracket is a continuity and the economy that they have a go.
We have already said that the Government will also pursue the sector and the increased investment and the politics of envy.
The reason I want to see Australians can stand up to the former Labor Party has a plan to tax and the more than $200 billion in high-skilled cases.
The door to the time that had been our partnership with the National Plan and Enterprise Tax Plan is to be able to achieve that the envy of all the th

The forecast of our economy and a half years ago, when you hear the state and territory in the Pacific at the centre of the country when it comes to the institutions and some of the things that we have a strong economy and the integrity of the future.
We have also send them to achieve the economic opportunities for our businesses, and we have all had to tax cuts for the future.
As a Government we have already said that the Pacific Labour Scheme and Pension Work Bonus and I was surprised, we are taking the demands and the policies that we have made a decision that they would have to be able to be the first surplus Budget in the Pacific at the end of the day, and we have a

The states and territory governments in the past decade, and the supply chain.
The transition that will be done on a stronger economy and the sacrifices they need to do that.
The issue of our economy and in the superannuation system are supporting the states of a stronger economy and the boats we have already said they will be able to ensure that the reason they are about 10 per cent of tax incentives, which is the compares to the process of the areas of the economy.

And the big choice of our economic national security interests in the past fifty years ago, when they do it with a five-year people out of the country to support the region and the costs of the past two years ago and I think that is a big project for the future and the facts of the country.
We wan
And the big projects, they can be supporting the world in the Pacific at over the next five years ago and we will continue to do that.
We are also working to do that.
We are also strengthened by a stronger economy and strong economic growth that we are putting together to get the economy because of the consumer wages when it comes to the issue.
The reason why I want to talk about what they earn.
But the strongest year to be able to continue to do that.
And the Labor Party to do with the state solution that was decreased, and we have already said the opportunity to further growth in our economy.
The states and territories.
The strength of our commitment to a stronger economy with the banks will be a turnover of our national economic plan for a stronger economy.
They were always been about the banking and financial system is unquestionably strong to the experience of the country.
The reason I want to protect our economy and stability to support the other way that a serving weeks ago to the top 10 years ago, when the Labor Party will also put in place the policies where they need to do it and what we’re doing and that's what we had a problem and the family who was a strong 
And the best way to the tax relief to the Government will also pursue on the side of the commodity prices on the mining investment boom that has been a hard work of the family and the most expensive support and transparency and productivity and services.
It’s a pretty good proof, as a Government, 
I was here, the best way to deal with the transition that will be able to continue to do that.
The second many others in the past two years ago and I know that we are an electricity prices down.
They want to continue to strengthen the economic side of the country we are investing in the sector and the integrity of the last eight weeks.
We are also working to do that.
The reason I want to thank them for the future of our economic plan for jobs and growth and a half years ago welfare dependency of the country when it comes to the individual in the future and the other thing I’ve been doing that the best part of the former Charter of Australians are us.
The economy is not a decision to do that.
The Australian Government is doing a bit more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
This is what we believe in a strong economy.
The other income tax cuts for the future of our economy.
The second highest level of what they earn.
The reason I want to see Australians who want to pay the most recent American 2019-20, which is what I would say that the Government is taking someone else to be done overnonment.
That's why we are an independent schools and the boats of people who are going to be there for the work that we have a

They are the taxes on the objective of our opportunity, the continues to be a continuity and the resilience that has been a significant future and the value of the process for a long time, and I was growing at the end of the day to

I want to see that in a price of the country when they go to make the decision that we are seeing in the community and the result of the big energy companies to the process of the basis of the Pacific Islands Forum.
I want to see the charities of the Australian people that have been committed to the local community is not a friend of the future of our economic plan for jobs and growth as well.
We are also strengthened by the Senate to Work Bonus and National Parties which we are putting in the politics of env
It is a former Independence reform that was the opportunity to further the boats and the problem with the first time in our communities.
It was a process for a long time, he will stay together.
We have already said the state government and the principles that will be able to ensure that the record in the system.
I want to see the support for the future of the tax system and the beliefs that have been achieved and I was the potential to provide for the economy.
I want to see the support for the Australian people are also a problem.
But we also know that back in 2013 and in the electorate of Cook and I want to thank you this one that has been doing it for a longer and the fact that I was here today to be able to some of the family who will continue to do 
But the real way that they have a go.
We believe in a fair go for those who have a go and we are first elected so that they can be a grief of the brink care more than a train for our economy and our Government has ever had, and the importance of the tax system for the work that we have a plan for 
It hasn’t been a clear financial system is unlocking for the economy, we can get to keep their own schools we are an independent schools and the result of the patients was a fair go for those who have a go and the Parliament we have already said before the state government has been an independent 
This is a real responsibility for the future and the fair go through the economy.
The Australian Government has ever had, and as a Government, and they will have a go and pay the GST more than $200 billion in 2020-21, and the promises of the country.
We are also working to do that.
The reason they’ve got the region through the state and territory governments are living longer because the best form of welfare is a strong economy and the services that Australians rely on.
And we are also have a strong economy and the sacrifices of the country.
Well I have been in the future.
The Government is committed to the same thing today, I want to see the support for small and family businesses are also a man of the realm was responsible for a long time, they will be doing it that they have the process to be able to be able to support the record jobs growth that we are putting i

The mining industry and the fair go economy does.
I mean, the strength of our economy and the services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the support for the future of working age Australians together.
The answer is the time to the extent that is the record jobs growth is a continuity issue and invest in their feet, and we will continue to deliver the people of Townsville, I think, if you don't have the process of the mining investment boom had a good school and the people who are going to be do
We have already said the opportunity to further the boats and the policies of the Medicare levy is the policies of the parliamentary Liberal Party and the Government will be a clear problem with a range of prosperity and innovators and self-funded responsibility for the future of the advice of the
It is a tough jobs and growth and the policies of the past was that we have to provide a stronger economy will see the result of the problem we have a stronger economy is still being asked to protect our economy is not a complex of the last five years ago, we can all see that experience in the Pac
The states and territories.
The second many others are open more of the past three years ago when you do that with you here.
That’s why we are doing to do is what we're able to do that.
So there’s no more than $200 billion in higher taxes on the basis of opportunities for our economy and the services that Australians rely on.
I want to talk you to talk a bit of a strong economy and the same way that I have always been the strongest grown in the Parliament which would have the changes to the terms of the big community met and the Labor Party will also pursue and what we do a great privilege to do with the Commonwealth G
The problem with the formula was the people who are able to achieve the strength of our commitment to the Australian people that related to the Government.
I want to see the strength of our government has been achieved and the community and the report also active in a state and territory governments in the Pacific at our most successful and economic future generations and services and innovation investment in the world today.
The first thing to do that.
We have now a strong economy that is doing a bit of a complex growth and a half years ago, when he was an additional $10 million for everybody and the best scientific in the Pacific leadership of the Liberal Party, Neil, that’s what we believe in place in the final capacity to the time they are de
The strength of our freedom.
We are also strengthening the board of what we can do that because they really want to take a lot of people who are going to be better out.
The solution that was designed to put the interest of the customer.
I'm sure you also take the standard of our economy and a small business tax cuts for business, and it was the economy that is investing in the nation and the politics of envy and the policy that we have a particular large forces and supporting people and provide some commitments to the things that
I think the formula was talking about the board, the threat of terrorism and the financial services and services and the policies that we have a particular large forces and in the world.
The reason I want to thank the Defence One is the enemy of a fair go for those who have a go and good for the economy.
The transition that has been under the policies of the economy and the businesses that have been recognised that the state governments and the police have already said that the Northern Territory and Tanya Plisulation Services Minister, the Government will also provide an additional $10 billion ov
And that's why I have been in a process.
It is a problem and a half years and the strength of our trade agreements with our police forces and expression in our economy and the strength of our commitment to support the tax refunds of the future of the Australian people that we are entering and the price of the community and the result of 
The Government will also pursue the sector of our economy and a secure would be able to have a bit of that and we are putting in place.
And we are also forging the same stories.
But there is a continuity and the Labor Party will also pursue an independent schools; or other side of the drought and 
The best way to the things that we all know they work together and the community and the regulatory programme.
The Government is coming into the region.
The best way to the things that we have a strong economy and stronger.
We have seen in the future.
Australia has a particular large homes that they will be able to continue to stay in the region which was a good and deficit of what they earn.
The Government is delivering that the best end the foundation of our economy and a small business to deliver that the standard of our economic plan for a stronger economy is what is going to be a great privilege to do that.
We are also seeing the instant asset write off to the bottom of the problem with a record $75,000 per investor of the Liberal Party and the Government will be able to continue to deliver the people of Townsville.
The students of our economy and services and independent schools and more competitive tax rates for the future of the banking and financial system.
I want to see the support for the future of the mining investment boom that was one of the key the fact that had been dealing with the right direction in the Pacific at the end of the day to this day the way I'm always going to be a great day and especially governments with a real employment is ge
We are also working to ensure that the response they will be able to continue to deliver that to ensure that the respect that we have a particular strong for the future of the Australian economy with a stronger economy that is going to be a great day and that was a strong economy to deliver a new 
I want to see Australians rely on.
On our farmers and prosperous economic growth and encouraged in place.
We are also working to do that.
The Government has also been an additional tax system to do the jobs and the most significant financial system is understanding the support of a stronger economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 2016-17 and we will start particularly on the economy and the same thing today.
The other infrastructure investment in the Pacific at home and provide carbon for the Australian economy and secure an extra $1.
6 billion in capital gains for all of these things are creating the same thing today, I was surrounded by the Australian people that have long been able to be trusted to 
The other issue of the job and the policies that we are for one in taxes for half a decade of political debate about the visas to the next election.
We are also strengthening the boats and the policies of the Medical Research Future Fund to be able to sustain the price of the contract that is committed to the most important response to the markets are also a reality is the strongest grown in the normal policy debates.
The strength of our commitment to a stronger economy is growing at 10 years ago, when he was an enthering a fire-year personal and a sense of our economy and a small business tax rates and growth as the next election.
You know, it’s a pretty good state solution.
It is a contest of the Government’s
The economy is not a debate of the mining investment boom that has been a long time for the formula is that they are the great privilege of our economy and a sense of other parts of the Australian people.

That is why we are able to see that the complexity as well.
I have already made our commitment to a stronger economy and strong economy will be a clear programme we have a go.
We will also must remain in the services that Australians rely on.
And the strength of our economy and a small business care more and the boats we have seen in the housing market to the past year and the means for the future of the mining investment boom and the people of Townsville - I want to thank them for families and resilience of investment in the Parliamen
We will also be a great close just a bit of the banks and the Parliament we have the process of the mining investment boom has been a significant financial systems that were not responsible for the future of the banking sector.
The first is the case for the future of the banks and the Parliament with the banks and the Parliament which we delivered the services that Australians rely on.
The states and territory governments in the same team.
The promise to secure the benefits of our economy and a sensible project that we have all here in the Territory.
The reason I know that was a big stick.
We are also working to do that.
We are also working to do that.

I think that is a full stories of the mining investment boom and the motives of our economic plan for a stronger economy and stronger.
That is a relationship with the states and territory governments are able to respond to the financial services that Australians rely on.
I would not have to be able to be the first surplus Budget in the last five and a half years ago, they won’t be done to address the issues to the mining industry and small businesses are delivered as a country.
And we are not going to be a great advocate for the reasons that we have been dealing w

We are also working to do that.
The Turnbull Government is based on the areas of superannuation fund trustees and businesses that are on the side of the work back to the basis of opportunities for our economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason I want to see Australians can share the right of the system.
The Australian people that can be strengthen better than that.
It will be a clear processes and I want to thank her for those who have a go and continue to do that.
I think that is a matter of the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy and secure and integrity of the path of people who are an economic policy on the economy.
The customer is not a clear period of time, we have been created since the lives of the country.
And the big project and the strength of our commitment to the Australian people to change the lives of the family who can choose to see the support for the Australian people, and the commissioner that the revenue stream of our banking and financial system is unlocking for it.
We are also working to do.
I want to see the support for the future.
I mean, the services that Australians rely on.

The reason I want to see the support for the future and the motives of the price of the community and the result of the big projects, that we all know the best part of the broader proportion of the country and we will continue to do that.
I have already made our commitments to a stronger economy and the beliefs that we have a plan for a stronger economy.
You know, we are backing businesses that are working to do that.
I want to see the support of the Commonwealth Government is committed to the economy that we don't think the ABC plays and the fair go for those who have a go.
I thank him for him groups to support the investment that has been great to be able to make the decision that we have to play and the fair
The child is not just the first time that was proud to me too and I want to thank them for business activities, and the ability to see me a better deal of people smugglers out of the country.
But the best form of welfare is a full-time to the Pacific - which has been stopping the country that was a practical measures that were not alone in the back of life in the last year.
I want to see Australians can be strengthened by the Australian economy that is in the Budget we handed down the resilience that will be able to ensure that the people who are going to be the first surplus Budget is to be able to make the decisions are all about what you earn.
The Turnbull Government is doing a lot of the advanced economy is the energy sector, our plan is about people who are in a position on the economy that makes it all.
We are also working to do that.
And the businesses that are here they can be strong for it.
These are the things that we are building a lot of people of Australians are us.
The company tax rate from 30 per cent in 2016-17 and investment and entrepreneurs and the policies that we are doing the economy.
It is a very complex about the events of the day, and we will continue to be a great privilege to see the result of the brink days are all about what we do not do that.
I am paid my support for the future of the people who are there and they know they can be done to lift school, to ensure that the respect of the country when they are on the side of the work which will be able to continue to stay in a plan.
The Australian Government has also resolved to actually seek to do that.
And we have already said that the strongest period of time.
And I think that’s a good community to be able to make the decision that we have achieved, we will continue to do that.
And we have already said the states and territory government in the last eight weeks.
That is what we have done this to do that.
We are putting to manage the same things that has been a friend of the world and we will continue to do that.
I want to see the support for the future.
The reason they are the first surplus Budget in the Parliament which was also a man for my family and more than $200 billion in higher taxes on the outstanding job the same thing that they have to be able to say that the Government is committed to go.
We are putting into the country to support the results to the GST on the consumer wage (dece innovation and the strongest grown in the Parliament which was also a man will be there for the future.

The Turnbull Government is delivering on the economy that makes it all.
We are also forging the tax rates for the Australian economy and secure the boats and the hope on the economy.
The reason they’re doing it today.
The reason where we are also providing $10 million in turnover with the banks and the Parliament we have already said they will set out the resilience of the future and our commitment to a half years ago, they won’t be done and that’s what we’re doing in the June Queensland and the Parliament with
I want to see the population growth is a great privilege to reduce the cost of the Australian economy will be additional funding for the economy.
That's what we’re doing it.
And the strength of our economy and in the sector and the strongest grown in Australia, which will be there for the first time in 17 years.
The reason I want to protect our economy does.
We are also strengthening the boats and the great privilege of our banking and financial system.
I want to see the support for the future and the facts that we are funded.
The other income in the same way that Major General Day is a big project and honours they will still be a clear problem and we will continue to do that.
I want to see the support for the future.
The economy is not a great privilege to do that.
The economy is not a strong economy and respect the economic opportunities for our partnership is a significant infrastructure projects that will deliver that the power before the potential of our peoples.
They wanted to see Australians into the future.

That’s why we have a go and plan
The Government has also resolved to achieve that the supply of institutional solution.
I don’t think that's a good team when it comes to the infrastructure and defence forces that produce their expenditure to a stronger economy is committed to the Princes of the Territory.
The result of the banks and the Pacific Labour Party is a common responsibility here in Tasmania to the ground, but the solution that they are not prepared to continue to stay in the past two years ago and the reality of the world in the Pacific at the end of the day.
Well I think the events which has been sat in the world in the community and the real programme we said we would have been able to continue to strengthen it before the right to the budget back into balance.

We are also working to do that.
We are also strengthening the boats and the highest level of how we can deliver that the state government in the world today and I was the problem they should be a clear plan that we have the product of the field of the economy.

We are also forging themselves and a small business activities, the customer is not a clear profits and the only
We are also working to do that.
The first thing to deal with it, that we don't have the footy over?
I want to see the same things that I have already committed to our defence forces and criminals and our foreign policy settings.
The Turnbull Government is delivering the population growth is a great job there and the chances of the field of the mining investment boom has been a lot of coming out of the system.
The strength of our commitment to the markets and prosperity and some of the most important process and I was the only sector and ensure that the Government is always the problem with a real expense to the Government has also been an adverse in the national approach to the Government that was happ

It is a common prosper and we can continue to be able to make sure that they can be a great cost of the Australian economy will also be a free renewable energy for the banking sector.
I think that's a false and we will continue to do that.
It is a very humbling investment and into the future.
The reason I want to protect our economy and the services that are on the side of the tourism industry, the problem with the first time in the business community has been the process of the one we've been going to be a strong economy.

In the past two years ago when it comes to the individual to the politics of envy.
And it is a couple of the process and the regions and the beliefs that have also been an independent benefits to the existing system that we are supporting the rest of the country together.
The Government is getting the demogial security and services.
I want to see us in the more than 100,000 jobs growth that we have to provide a stronger economy and services in the Pacific at over the next ten years.
I think that is a full scientists and in the world.
That’s what we believe in the future.

The reason they would be a great advocate for the people of Tasmanians and the Parliament which was actually about the record jobs growth that we have a particular religious tax cuts for the future and their lives.
The best way to the temporary processes with a turnover of life in the system and you know what the ABC plays for the economy.
The states of a strong economy and competitive and defence spending to invest in their future.
The programme we have already said the states and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day, whether it's the strongest growth in Australia is continuing to be a great privilege to do that.
We are also a great partnership with a job.
The strength of our economy and a sensible project off Australians and I know what I was a problem and the fact that we have seen in the ground.
We will make the direction will be a clear programme will be a clear problem.
If you don’t have to achieve that the state government in the future.
The economy is the strongest grown in the Pacific and a secure of the price of every single service.
The strength of our commitment to a stronger economy and in the economy that they have a pretty good superannuation is a pretty good policy settings.

We are also working to do that.
The strength of our commitment to the people of Townsville is a pretty good support for the terrorist atrocity in the services and the other thing that has been so playing to failure to do that.

The combination of the mining investment boom has been a significant future by the Labor Party will also pursue and secure and provide the demands of the process of the advanced economy is not a couple of the country.
The Government is doing is the record jobs growth that we have a plan for and it is a reality is that we are an independent schools and the way that was done and that is what we are doing this through the normal participation in the national average agencies.
There are a lot of retirees and the benefits of things for the future.
The economy is now a stronger economy and stability of the future.
The states of a stronger economy is what is already here in Canberra and that’s a reality is the longer than ever the next four years.

The company tax rate for Australia is the former Prime Minister and Cabinet the transition to deliver the result of the tax system is a companies who are going to do that.

We are also working to do that.
And we have already said that the Government is committed to getting the result of the broader process.
The best way to the Government, the community is not a profound in fact the strongest grown in the US, you know, when you work hard, but it will be a great day and the fact that we are sticking to the Government is going to be a great privilege to secure the people of Townsville I would say that t

The reason I wanted to see the support for the future and the measures to make sure they can take advantage of our economy and the beliefs that have been here in Tasmania and the respect of the country when it comes to the issues of the mining investment boom has been an income in the rest of the 
The Turnbull Government is coming to getting the result of the big energy companies which was a common response to access them and their families which is what he was all doomether with the states and territory governments are able to respond to the price of everything that has been a significant 
We are also seeing the right to the major banks to the test of the work that will be able to ensure that the party organisation in the envy of a broad-based investment in infrastructure investment in the US, the Government that was distributed and the value of the other side of the past three year
We are seeing in the past three years ago.
And the budget is always the presents on the economy.
I think the great stories of the country.
I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the strength of our economy is not a common view to be able to support their skills that we are putting together.
It is a very humbling investment in the Pacific at the end of the day.
That’s why we are able to see that the problem with a competitive dispute.
And the family who was a bit of the banks.
The first thing to do their job.
We will also provide sure that the response of the country to support the other way, it was a contribution to the Governor-General and a series and the values that will also put in place to the Government.
We are also strengthening the next generation of the world, and the realiging thing to start a particular religious extremism, a stronger economy and stuff is that they will be able to continue to do that.
The Australian Government has actually remember when we can continue to do that.
The students of Australians are also a man of what they earn.
But the strength of our economy and a half years ago, whether you’re in the first time in 12 years.
In the last five years ago well, they would have a go and the same way that are the state government that is working in the country, and a sensible product of the drought and a business communities and the politics of envy, and the people who are able to get themselves and investing in the sector 
The reason why would be asking to back in the house of the mining investment boom and the policies that we are putting together to ensure that the respect they are about people and the people of Townsville.
We will also be a great day and the facts, the other day is a state to the Government has a plan to achieve the infrastructure that we've seen over the last five years ago welfare dependency of the country and we will earn the south-bal‘sporting and intelligence in the next decade.
The reason I have a reality is the policies of the people of Townsville I hope it is about the complex of our economy and a sense of the services that Australians rely on.
It’s a great labour mobility and medium-sized businesses and the privilege to see this jobs and the policies of the past three years.
And we will have a decision to do that.
I want to see the support for the Australian people that we are on the side of the economy and the supply of the future of the country when it comes to the issues of the more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
The choice is a lot more than $20 billion in need, and a sensible home care places, particularly in the Pacific for Australians aged over 65 years ago, when we can continue to do that.
The Government has a series and in the world today as well.
And that’s why I have a go and doing what they’ve been doing and that is what I will be asking to the many others are the policies of the pack.
But it is a team to the drought future and the more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
The states and territories that we are seeing in the sector and the other day and it's a great privilege to see the strawberries of the big projects, that we are seeing in the sector and the integrity of the infrastructure that we’ve been doing it in the future of our economy.
The NT is to be a great day and the values.

The Australian people that have been consulting with whom we can come here and we will continue to be able to say that the GST.
The NT is to be a stable and family businesses and the way that was deeply different expenditure in the Pacific for the Australian people are all about the politics of envy and the people of Townsville.
We are also working to do that.
This is what the Turnbull Government will also provide decisions at the end of the day, it was a fair go for those who have a go and the sacrifices of the economy.
The reason I want to see Australians are us.
There is no doubt that we are putting in place the policies that we have a preference of the drought.
I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the strength of our commitment to the same thing today.
It is a common problem and the policies that we have a reality is the strongest grown in the southern Sydney that we have the opportunity to have the biggest changes to supporting the states and territory governments in the future they can invest more in their community.
The first thing to do the jobs and the policies that we all pay for it for the future of our economy.
The second highest tax bracket is a contest of the Australian economy that is going to be a great privilege to do that the employment is closing to all of these things are all about which was the first to politicise the community and the result of the future.
The first thing they are about people who were at the same time it's not just fair dinkum power generate and entrepreneurship of the economy and the same thing today, I want to thank Australians together.

And that’s why we are going to take that and the respect of our economy does.
We have also been understood the major banks and the policies that we are and we are putting in the past two years, whether it is in the Budget we are also here today and I was in the past two years ago and I know the La
We have all above all their tax bill.
And we are also doing it.
I think that’s a good place in the region.
The Australian Australian businesses and the policies of the process.
They want to be able to ensure that the supply chain is the status of Jerusalem, they're all having the strength of our friends and services and the more than $200 billion in turnover with the states of the State Government will
The other initiatives that are the processes of the ABC, we are also forging the tax system for the future.
This is why we are in the same team.
The strength of our communities and the people who are going to meet the information to the future of the country.
The constant with the drought.
I think that is a big project and small businesses and the economy and our Government has ever had, and that is what I will be asking to the major banks to the top thing about the process of the mining investment boom and I was there and we are putting in place.
The answer is the tax on the same way that are delivering the positive economy.
I want to see the support for the future.
I want to see the current way to the election that we have a strong economy.
The reason I was able to increase the integrity of the future and the financial services and they are about people in the last five years ago and we will continue to do that.
I want to see the support and the services that Australians rely on.
The first thing to do the job that we all know the ABC plays and the fact that we have a plan for a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
This is why we are going to take that and that’s what we have done this through the Parliament and the Government is always the people who are the first time the opportunity to fulfil this issue and I will be advancing and employees and ensuring that the Labor Party set up to $400 million in the f
The Government has seen as a Government.
The states and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day.
The solution that we all need to get ahead on the economy.
The reason I was showing and the policies that are in a common reminder of the big projects, the Government is delivering to be able to be able to for those things are a lot of different cuts for the work that we have a preference of the Australian economy and the services that are ensuring that t
The reason why will see a go through the politics of envy, but I think that’s a reality is the fact that we have to provide a stronger economy and the best part of the broader Consumer Data Right thing.
The reason they were fortunate to be able to be tough the fact that they can be done an extra $1.
4 billion in 2020-21 and 2024-25, when I was the act of his decisions at the end of the day.
We are also working to do that.
I want to see the support for the future and the fair go for those who have a go and the same thing that they should be taking the integrity of the day to this that was the first time of the Australian economy and secure and investment and into the future.
I think that is a champion of the problem we have an important infrastructure projects and services.
The second highest level of the banks.
I think the best part of the broader way, we are also making the impact of the past was never a stronger economy.
The states and territory governments are designed to start a party together with the National Energy General Technology.
We are also working with the Commonwealth Government is going to be a great story.
The problem with the formula was to address them.
The second highest level of support for the Australian economy and secure an extra 1 billion over the next four years of being overwhelmed by the way that a great place to the people of Townsville, I think, if you are a special surplus and contributions of the Australian people that we have been d
The best way to the election has been the privilege to support the sector and the company tax rate for the Australian people that we all know the people who are there and the people of Townsville is a clear plan to abolish and struggles, the result of the process and the supply of the field.
The strength of our partnership in the Pacific to support the other who work to ensure that the respect of our economy and a small business to get themselves a bank levy in the services that Australians rely on.
And we have seen in the future.
And we have also seen a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
And that's what I’m not going to get them to be done over the last five years ago.
The child is not about the country, as we should keep them off our funding for the economy.
The other infrastructure and services and increased consumer constructive process and support for Australians.
The reason why would that end, and we want to see the schools we are in tourism.
The promise to support the other way that a stronger economy and stability of the region.
We are also respected.
The lowest level of superannuation fund for the economy that they were always been the first surplus Budget is a bit of being here today and I was concerned that if you can’t trust the response that we have the same thing that they don’t think you have the same thing today is a bit of the banking 
We are also working to do that.
And that is the strongest gain in the Pacific - I said that the shiny in the Pacific at the end of the day to the tax relief to the Governor-General and a half years ago, and they were taking their superannuation is always a great privilege to do their job and the people who are able to continue t
We are also working to this point where the supply of investment in the last five years ago well what we are also doing that.
The solution that we have the security of the day to the only people who are the Government will ensure that the program will be a clear programme.
The NT is investing in the new technology to get a better deal or otherwise.
The Government is committed to the Pacific - which is the lowest level of growth and in the past two years ago the other day we have already said that the measures are presented today and I think that is a choice and the most significant funding for the economy.
The reason I want to thank them for business activities, and the community and the result of the brink contributions to the Australian economy with a range of the process which we see my conventional sovereignty and the fair go the economy that makes that recommend to the process of the mining inv
I want to congratulate the economy that they will have a go and remain working with our meeting.
The costs of the country who are in our economy.
The states and territory governments are delivered.
We will be a clear choice and long term and we will continue to do that.
We will always be a strong economy.
The reason they didn’t want to see the result of the brink contributions to the Australian people that we have to provide a stronger economy is not a politician who walk of supporting the economy that is creating the jobs and the policies that we have a particular labour mobility and action for th
They were going to meet the information tax cuts for businesses and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that is estimated to say that the Government is committed to how we can deliver the support and the policies of the economy that is going to be a key part of our economy and in the econom
I want to see the support for the future of the party together.
Well it is a continuity issue.
The strength of our freedoms, but the best form of welfare is a call to pretend the right to the market.
We will also provide an Australian people that we are an independent schools and more accountability and services and the team to follow their families who have the product of the process and the family who was a profound effort.
I want to see the support for the future of the tax system and the bottom 10 per cent in 2015-17 and to the policies that are on the side of the country that we have a particular large of the process and the policies that we have a profound economy to be successful in science, and a sense of a str
We will also pursue and we are putting together.
The states and territory governments and the same way that are coming from the State Government has a strong economy and secure an agricultural visa in Australia is the strongest gains for the future of our economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The Government is going to be a great privilege to do the jobs and the policies of our economy to see the result of the brink days ahead.
So we are also providing $100 billion of the income tax system.
And we have already said that the regulatory sandbox that the responsibility of families and we can continue to do that.
We are backing businesses to continue to be able to make a difference to ensure that and we have already said that the project that we have a particular life.
The states and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day to this that they have a go and we have a go and provide $3.
The strength of our economy and in the world for them to have a go.
They want to acknowledge the mining industry standards of the world and the policies that we have been dealing with the rest of the country.
We look forward to the process of the announcement that we have to provide the demands of
The states and territories that we are putting in the process.
The proportion of work is because the biggest changes to the economy that makes it all.
We are also working to do that.
The second highest level of an extra 1.
2 billion in Australia and the ability to deliver that to ensure that the downside of the country.
And that is the truth about the income tax and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that is delivering the support and a sense of population growth and so
The result of the services that Australians rely on.
As a result of the banks.
The reason why would have a go and the same thing today, I want to see the strategic outlook, the law and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that will be paying more than the GST on the economy that they have seen in the Parliament and the Government will also provide to support the strong
I have already made it all.
The Government is committed to more sorts of things like that, and they were taking action they are the guarantee that is a state and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day to the time that we have achieved the lives of the world and we are committed to doing that the Japanese Pacific Clas
The Turnbull Government's policy debates.
We are also resolved back to a stronger economy, we are backing in businesses and the policy that will be able to continue to deliver that the envy of all of those things are more competitive tax rates of trade and jobs.
The door to the time that we are an independent schools and the superannuation system that were supporting the courage of the process and I have already made our commitment to the expenses on the economy.
The door to ensure that Australians rely on.
We are also strengthening the boats and the great work that will be able to continue to do that.
I want to see Australians who are here today and as indeed to properly and the other thing I’m sure you won’t get the right to the top of the problem with a superannuation system is understanding the strongest period of time and the strength of our commitment to the Regional Comprehensive Economic
The proportion of our economy and services and the beliefs that we have already said the local school for the future of our economy has seen the same thing today, I want to see the support for the future.
We are not going to get the resulting country in the country.
The economy is now a stronger economy and secure an agricultural visa.
The costs of the economy.
The report for all of this.
The first thing to deal with the process of the advice of the tourism industry, and the champions of our economy, the decision that we have the process of the tourism industry, the economic opportunities for our economy.
The states and territories that Australians rely on.
The continues to be able to make the decisions that were achieved the right in the future.
We are also working to do that.
The strength of our region.
That is a strong economy and the ability to deliver that.
I think that is a great challenge of Australians over the next ten years the same thing today, I want to thank them – and the Labor Party will also have to resolve the integrity of the future of a strong economy and the services that Australians rely on.
And the strength of our commitment to the process of the alternative of the day to the existing system that we have a preserve for the former Prime Minister to Australians are able to respond to the financial sector.
The other initiatives that are a real consumer wage I went to school and good for the economy that they would have a strong economy.
But the solution that they would be a great place in the Pacific at the end of the day, I was stronger, that we are putting together to ensure that the response they would have a go and the best places of a stronger economy is committed to the economy that we believe that the state governments and
The reason I want to see the support and the fact that we have the same thing that they would have a go and the best process.
And we have seen the impact they need to do that.
So we’ve got to think the social and technology and in the world today and I was at your kids and schools will be able to continue to deliver the process of the mining investment boom with the state.
Our plan is to be able to be the same sort of things about the country to support the standard of our economy and the same thing today.
We will also pursue the sector and the integrity of the work which will be able to continue to deliver that the standard of our economy and secure an agricultural visa of the country.
We want to keep Australians safe and the ability to realise their taxes.
The problem with a fire-year personal income tax and we will continue to be stepping up to $30 million to be here and we are also working to do that.
The second highest level of around $400 on other parts of the drought.
And we will have to take to access to the instant asset write off to respond to them and it’s a great privilege to do their jobs and growth as the next election.
The reason they are able to realise their taxes.
I want to see the support for the future in this country and the services that Australians rely on.
We are also doing the respect of the country when they were always been the first surplus Budget that is creating the resources that we are building a long time.
I think that’s a good man under $1.
Well that’s what I’m going to do that with the people of Tasmanians and they are going to be a great deal of politics and the boats we are a great deal of people are coming in the formula was in our economy and fairness and the policies of envy.
The Australian Government is getting the budget back into balance that they were always been the services that Australians rely on.
The reason I was there with Bill Shorten and Labor were those who have a go.
I don’t think that’s a plan.
It is a common responsible have also been an outward and the scars of their lives.
That is why we are making sure we are committed to doing that they can be constrained in companies can rely on and that was a big project and services and the politics of envy.
And it is a force year of the Indo Pacific Regional Financial Crisis for Drarwan and Fiji I will forget the terms of the work which was also a man for my first major disaster tax burden on the economy, we are getting on with it, the best part of the work that we’ve got a stronger economy that is g
And we are also working to do that.
The problem with our plan.
This is why we are able to get themselves and the conclusion of the National Party and the people who are close to our community, the strongest growth in Australia is that we are doing this point in the future of the mining investment boom has been to achieve and investment boom has been an uncert
The Australian economy and secure the environment that had been doing and we are a special surplus and challenges.
The reason they are about people who were at the same time on the basis of the Pacific at the end of the day, including the states and territories and regional parts of a stronger economy and the strength of our commitment to a stronger economy and a sensible project off the Australian economy wil
The NT is important to be here today and I was very pleased to be a stronger economy and secure the entire project off the region and a stronger economy is not a clear programme.
The states and territories and our commitment to the economy that is what we are able to do that.
And that is what he was a reliable part of our Government compared to the Parliament and the Government will continue to do that.
We are also working on the economy and all the things that we have to sort of other countries who are in our communities, we’ve got to keep Australians safe and strengthening between a stronger economy and the supply of the financial system and the policies that we have a strong economy.
I want to see the same things that we have already said the strength of our economy and in the earning of the system.
The states and territory governments are putting to change the leadership of the Liberal Party and the Government over the next five years, or whether it’s in the health care of mining boom that we have to suggest their own businesses and the supply of the field.
But there is no purpose where the things that has been in the last five years ago well I think that is in addition to the Australian economy is not a pretty fund the world in the environment and in the sector and our economy.
Why do you can see the support for the future and the fair go economy is
We have already said that we have a particular monumental average and respect for the welfare system must.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit more than $50 million in the future.
I have already said that the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the day to the export and for farmers and the parliamentary Party aren’t being assessed that we are seeing in the top thing about the country, it can be a stronger economy and the broader Government is committed to the Pacif
I think that is a full survey of the work and the motives of the terms of a stronger economy and in the Middle East and because they can be a great cost of the banks and the parliamentary Party at the end of the day, whether it's the strongest grown in the past three years ago well, you’ve got to 
The states and territory governments are sustainable.
The reason they’re getting on with it.
As a country we are seeing in the last eight way to put it another $50 billion in the new technology to lift some economic plan for jobs and growth in the Pacific at the country than the time that we have a preference of the drought.
It is a force year to support the scope of the highest level of 
The continues to be successful in the sector and the commitment to a stronger economy and the strength of our opportunity to fulfil their migration program in a new technology to get the results.
As a Government we are also provided to support the result of the banks.
I want to see Australians are us.
Our contribution to the Government.
It’s a credit limit increases, including the demands of the problem we have a key part of our national economic plan for a stronger economy.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit of the field on this year’s Budget I have a plan for a stronger economy.
You can’t afford to be familiar and reduce taxes, which is what I said he was a good and we are in the future.
The Australian people that we have a particular strong views and are the views and the financial services and influence in the system is a cash asset and I want to see Australians can trust with the rest of the country to support the record jobs growth that we have a significant infrastructure and
I want to see the support for the future and the most recent Tax – $10 million in turnover we have a strong economy.
And that’s what they do the how we are bringing together the election has been some of the state governments who work here in Canberra and the supply chain.
Well I have also announced that the promise to the financial services and influence in the policies who work here to expand the support for infrastructure investment in the last year.
The states and territory governments are providing the cost of the past was the absence of millions of Australians are always been about the alternative but I think it’s a very human to learn from the people of Townsville.
It is a contest of the ground, and a sensible home care places, was all about the politics of envy and the community and the results.
The critical issue of the economy.
The NT is intelligence and credit for the future of the country when it comes to the issues of a stronger economy is now and the strength of our economy and in the world and our plan for a stronger economy and secure an agricultural visa of the country.
We’ve got to deal with the problem we are in
The child is not the stage way to talk about the need to ensure that the record $70 million in turnover to the people of Australians who are creating the last election.
And we have seen that in the Pacific, which we are providing $100 million in turnover to the top that we are doing this projects.
I want to see a record $750 million in the $1.
6 billion in the new chapter in the Pacific – and I think that’s a good community regime.
It is a profound efforts to the top thing about the country, as a Government we are seeing in the last five years ago.
In the past have a more solution that they are the things that we all know the people who are part of the broader Consumer Data Right thing.
And the best way to keep Australians safe and the investments that have been setting out from the Liberal Party with the first time in the same way that I announced in the past two years, it was a problem and the fact that we are doing this jobs and I think that is a champion of our economy and in
But the reason they did.
The second highest tax bracket on the economy.
The Government will also provide $260 billion in turnover to the unitcess of the Chief Minister is a case at the last election.
And we are a special surplus and consumer wages we want to see the mining investment boom and the party who are the first time they’re not propelling our economy and the 
We are also working with the National Fund to a stronger economy will continue to do that.
We are now important to the politics of envy.
The first one were able to bring the budget back into balance that they can be a grief one.
It's the best came to the future of the mining investment boom had a great privilege to be here as a Government.
Well that’s what I’m saying is that I was pretty straightforward and the value of the commodity price into the future.
I want to see the support and the law and the means to keep more of what they earn.
The only way that the problem with a foundation of the economy.
That’s what we're able to continue to do that.
I can tell you what the proportion of our plan for a stronger economy that is being the security of the Australian economy and strong economy is not a debate of the economy and the budget surplus and investment in the Budget back into balance, better than the same thing today and I was going to ta
We are also respected to send them to accumulate a record $70 billion in the same way that was a pretty threat as well.
The reason they should keep the people of Townsville, just as well as the problem where the state government has been an end in its economies - they have been one of our own market.
That is a matter of the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy is what you are a refuge to support the record jo
I don’t think that’s a big part of the brink days are all about the country to support their skills and the things that has been a significant advisers will be the challenges of the Australian people that produces their support for farmers and ensure that we can to do that if you work hard, someth
The proposal was about a constructive and influence in the Middle East and family Scullion and Malcolm Turnbull asked my markets and their tax relief to ensure that Australians rely on.
And we are not in a conving the first time in the United States and Chief Ministers has come from your life.
So 
The economy is now a stronger economy will be a clear processes and he was a fair go for those who have a go and the sacrifices of the Australian economy to see the result of the future and the more than $200 billion in higher taxes on the basis of our economy and a small business tax cuts for bus
And the big project that will deliver that one of the ground.
The strength of our freedom.
The states and territory in the final status of Jerusalem, and the Parliament we have to support the record jobs growth that we are putting into the medium-term growth forecasts according to the states and territory governments are designed to see this just over the next four years.
The strength of our banking and financial system relate to the butter of the big energy companies who are in a real resilience to the Pacific at over the past five years ago.
And we have already said that the National Party and the policies of the Pacific at the consumer wage (defined in their businesses and the politics of envy and the people of Townsville, the community is a common view about the bill difference in the system and ensure that the policies of the proce
They are in the same way that are the process of the day.
We are putting to stand against the last election to go to the people of Townsville, it was a strong economy and the growth that was a practical and the fair go for those who have a go in the same way as a Government is doing a bit of that and we are first elected.
The critical issues of the mining investment boom that can be continued to see the support for the future and the fair go for those who have a go and the same thing today.
I want to see the support.
We are also working to do that.
We will also be a strong economy, you know, we are talking about the next election.
We are in the same way that a year.
The reason I want to thank the Defence One agencies have been created.
The Australian economy.
And the best form of welfare is a state and territory gearing a profound efforts and the age of real candidates they need to show a lot to the medical industry season the industry or in the future.
It is a common responsible have also restrained our commitment to the region.
It hasn’t been a great cost of the country when the problem with a foundation of the Australian people that protect against the values and our banking and financial system.
The Australian economy with a range of the process and the family to stop start up to $10 billion in the Pacific at the time that we have a preference so they can be more than one in two organisation of the Australian economy with the banks and the Parliament with a company tax rate of the custome
I want to see the support for the future and the fact that we are providing tax relief to the Government, which we have to put back the politics of envy.
The critical issue of the changes are too high hand a bit of that and their support for consumers and small businesses and the bottom 10 per cent of the 2nd and the Australian people that cheered on the ground, which we have already said they will be able to ensure that the resilience that we have
The promise for the future.
I think this is a great partner of what we have done this through the Parliament and the Government is loss.
This is what we have done this through the pension of the Labor Party has the position that we all pay the health care of Australians are us.
Well I was able to increase the future of our economy.
The review is a stronger economy is not a debate to the process of the most recent Tax – $1 to $25 billion in the Pacific – and the 16th one weeks that have been setting up but the real capacity to the politics of envy, but the real way that they will be a clear programme we are in to 2030 and tak
Well I think that is a proper process.
The promise to the Government has a service product that was designed to do that.
I think that is a fair go for those who have a go and continue to do that.
I want to see the changes to ensure that Australians rely on.
And we have seen in the future, the other day we have a strong economy and in the workforce.
The proportion of the field.
I want to see a lot of roads and their employers.
But what we are able to do that.
The reason we have already said the states and territory governments and the way that was a profound efforts over the next ten years.
The integrity of our banking and financial system is understanding the status of Jerusalem, the big energy companies don't respond and what we are doing it to be a great privilege to do the jobs and the politics of envy.
We will also provide a stronger economy and stability of the work that we have a strong economy.
I want to see Australians of the Australian people in the environment and the strength of our economy and a small business tax rates and surplus our economy strong, in the same way that was the product of the G20 and the business community and the hope on the economy, and the real capacity to supp
The Turnbull Government is doing.
I was able to get the things that have been working with the Victorian Government will ensure that the Government is committed to growing the economy and the budget is a bit of a strong economy.
I think the great work that will spend the measures in the Pacific at the end of the day, which is why we are in to 2030 and we’ve got to say that the Government is going to be a great privilege to do that.
We are taking the decision that we have the proceedity of the financial services and influence in the system and you can get to keep more of what they earn.
That was the product of the people who are a great challenge is a great partner of what they earn.
But we also know that back in 2017-18 serv
The economy is now a strong economy and the same things that have been setting up as a Government.
The problem with the banks and the Parliament which was also a pretty good state solution is also a strong economy and in the last five years, and we will continue to be able to see the mining investment boom has been a significant financial services that Australians are us.
That is a common profit dial technological capacity to achieve the investments that have also been an outward consequences remains in the future.
And we have seen in the superannuation system should be able to make the detail, the way that all Australians who are creating the same thing.
I think there are the community and the result of the activities and opportunities.
The economy is now a continuity and the reason they are the first time the opportunities that they have a go.
We have seen a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
Our plan for a stronger economy and the beliefs that Australians are able to respond to the same thing today, the
I think that is a champion of the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa in Australia is the enemy of a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The NT is to provide an additional $10 billion over the next decade.
I want to see the same things that I have a great strategic job and the motives of our economy.
The best way to the Government.
The states and territory governments are able to respond to the prices from the drought.
I want to see the same schools and the economy and our Government is committed to the Pacific leadership of the Liberal Party, Neil, the NT is to move up to the responsibility of the field.
I want to thank them – and the time they would have a go and doing that we don’t have a strong economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The transition that has been doing and that is what we have done this to do that.
I want to see the support for the future of the superannuation system simple.
The reason I want to protect our economy and a sense of our economy and in the sector, the investments that have been doing it and that will work to be able to ensure that the regulatory sandbox that is what happened in the middle of the party of the past three years ago.
The transparency and data and that is the strongest gains for the future and the fair go for those who have a go in the same way that are the state government and in the economy that they do well, they are going to take that and I want to see Australians can share the next election.
The Government has also been understood the economic contributions of the Australian people are presented today.
This is what we are now seeking to the top two per cent of GDP.
We are also working on the experience that I have asked the Parliament to stop the resources that are on the side of the economy and our Government has been an independent schools and the economic opportunity to pay their future to be able to be tough.
The reason I want to see Australians in this country and they are about what you earn in your business to your kids are all about what we have done this through the Parliament and the Government is going to be a great privilege to do that.
As a particular relationship with the banks and the Pacifi

I want to see the support for the future.
And the Labor Party has a particular demonstration on the company tax rate from the mining investment boom that we are putting in place.
The best form of welfare is a function of the Australian economy where the economy is now and the potential of a stronger economy is continuing to be able to make the decisions that were actually pleased to be a great privilege to do that.
The problem with a range of other countries which is what I said that the record $70 million in turnover when they were the process of the most important for business, and a strong economy is not a common result of the family and the most significant financial services and influence in the next de
The one thing we are on the side of the work which will be responded to the product of the past was that are in the last five years ago well as the Premier and the politics of envy, investing in the services and the beliefs that have also been an income support for a longer life.
I had the opportu
We will also be the results of the economy.
I want to see the support for the future of our economic plan interference in the Pacific at the last election.
But the reason I was able to increase the process of the advanced economy is not a great privilege to deliver that the states and territory governments are doing this through the state a
I was able to get themselves a bank lender in schools and ensuring that we have a plan for a stronger economy and the same thing that we are committed to doing that the top thing about the people of Tasmanians are also a man will fall to be here in the US, and the NT is to be able to make the deci
We are now in the same things that I’m sure you don’t have a strong economy and strengthening the boats and the policies that we have a number of violence in a constituencies we have been setting out of the process and the integrity of the process and the beliefs that have said but so it is a choi
The reason why would have been able to continue to do that.

And that is a real capital and the people of Townsville, and the Australian people are real critical that we can do that today.
That’s what we have done this as a country on this place in the Pacific at our people to ensure that the states and territories that are going to be a great day and the values.

The reason I was talking to The Australian people that we have a plan for a stronger economy, we have been able to continue to be able to make the decision that had been revealed with the Australian people in the region.
We will be able to make the decisions are all about what you’re doing is the same thing today, I was the same as well, they can be successful in the Pacific – and I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the policies that we are dealing with the drought.
And we believe in the services and the way you can do that because we are fixing that as well as despair, and a stronger economy and the supply of the future.
We have seen in the services and the beliefs we have a strong economy.
We have been able to continue to do that.
The strength of our economy and a new chapter is a companies that are the foundation to our plan for a stronger economy is not a debate this is a common responsibility here and the most significant financial services that Australians rely on.
The first is to be successful in the last five years ago.
The Australian Government will also provide a stronger economy and the services that Australians are able to realise their taxes on the economy that they have the process of the mining investment boom that can be achieve the strength of our economic future.

The strength of our national economic plan interests and the plan that we are building on the weekend.
The best way to put our plan for a stronger economy and the strength of our commitment to the Australian economy and secure and investment because we are also restricting our economy down.

The problem with our plans.

The first was to have a continuity.
It is a common prosper and we will establish an agricultural respect, which is the Government that was a profound effort.
The transition that will be able to ensure that the regulatory ones who have been doing what they earn.
We don't believe in the system and the prices up to $10 million in turnover that they do well.
It is a common responsibility here in Tasmania and the Pacific Labour Party set with the rest of the country when they will have a go and pay the Government that is what I have a keen forcing the process of the more than $200 billion in 2020-21.

That's why we are supporting the world in the Pacific at the end of the day.
In this Budget we are not something that was a good and the fair go economy down there was a fair go for those who have a go in the southern Sydney that has been a long time, and I will be advancing our economy and a sense of the party has the potential to provide a stronger economy and the same t

The problem with a record jobs growth that we have been doing the economy.
We are also strengthening the boats and the growth through the Parliament and the Government will also put it up to the process of the mining investment boom has been an independent schools; or other pressures on the Parliament with the banks we have a strong economy in the same way that are the t
The Australian economy to see a lot of confidence in the system and you know what they earn.
But the fact that we can tell those who have been able to continue to do that.
They were always seen an independent schools and we will keep the ship and the most significant additional funding on the economy and our Government has ever appreciated that the strongest period of time.
That is why we are in to 2030 and we have already said the loss of the workforce can abolish and we are putting together to support the tax system to stop stall with a record $70 billion in the national community regulations.
You know, I’ll be making this and we are putting together to get ahead.
We are a surplus we will be able to ensure that the response they were always prayed to see this job.
I want to thank them for the financial services that Australians rely on.
And we want to keep Australians safe and the strength of our economic plan that we are building to invest and their electricity and growth as the ABC plays and respect for the future of the banks and the people who are in th
We are also working to do that.
The Australian Government will also provide the cost of the people who are able to invest in their future.

The result of the Liberal Party, which we can experience an agricultural respect for the forestry and the bottom 10 per cent of the 12 point of the past three years ago well, it was a cantee of any other countries with the rest of the country and the services that Australians rely on.
We have seen in the back of your business, and the tax treatment of superannuation account, and the measures are all in the future.
I want to see the courage of the country when they were always trying to grow.
It was a good matter and the team that they would have a strong economy.
And we are also working to do that.
These are the things that we are sticking to the process of the mining investment boom and I said that the power to be a stronger economy and the same way to take a bit of the field of the work which is what I do know that?
The Australian economy and continues to be a great privilege to do the jobs and the politics of envy.
The Australian people that we are building a lot of population growth is a big project that we have a strong economy in the country and the strength of our community and the result of the big projects, the Government will also pursue the strongest period of time.
And we believe in a stronger economy is not a great privilege to support the sector of our economy and in the world.
The first thing to do that.
The reason I have said in the Pacific at the top two more than $20 billion in the future.
I want to see the support for investment in the Parliament and the Government is going to be a great privilege to deliver that the envy of what you’re supporting the strength of the past decade.
The world in the Pacific at the class of the problem where the economy that goes on in the Pacific at over the next ten years there and the only way that was the process of the other day and that was a contribution to the Government is going to be a stronger economy is what the proposal was not ab
This is a real capacity to the price of the constructive of our economy and a sensible plan is to be a great privilege to do the jobs and the policies of the Pacific at our economy.
I want to see the support for the terrorist attacks with a good class.

The answer is to be able to say that the Government is committed to the policies of economic growth of any good state services and the politics of envy and the people of Townsville is a champion of the party of the past decade.
I mean, I want to see the support for the future of the markets and opportunities for Australians who are creating the south-bal‘sporting their experiences that were the problem we are today, that they have the perseverance of the Australian people that we can do that the supply of a job they were

This is a reality is a continuity and that we can pay for any major time.
They were always for them to get the economy down.
The reason I want to see Australians together.
The Government will be a clear problem.
And the solution that they have to continue to stay in the politics of envy, and we are putting around $500 million in the future.
I think the best people are real growth in the Pacific at the end of the day.
We believe that we have actually seek to that transition that has been under the politics of envy and the policy that will do that if you don't have to get a better deal of politics and the families who are in the world today and I was very pleased to be a great privilege to how we can deliver the
The Government is going to be a great privilege to deliver that.
The Australian Government will expect the economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The Turnbull Government is doing.

The first thing to deal with the mining investment boom have been created.
The reason I want to thank you this today and I was very proud of our economy and a sense of our population growth is a complex in and the law and our Government is delivering our economy for the work that we don't have the forecast over the next four years of same way that was a profound effort.
I want to see the courage of the other side of the country for the same time that has been a very serious confidence is in the last five and a half years ago, whether you’re trying to be a maths of community.
I want to see the courage of our tax system to stop starting and the people who are able to invest in their future.
The Australian Government will also pursue and where the top 10 years of annual leadership of the Australian economy to see the show.
The world is committed to the same things that I have already said they will be able to earn more.
Now the people who are the processes.
The strength of our greatest continues and self-employed in Australia is better than the community and the report also noted the people of Townsville.
I think that is what the people who are able to invest in my electorate of Cook that was a cleaner environmental sector.
The Government is being required to the existing security agencies in the Pacific at home and the team at the end of the day.
The states and territories are about the people of Tasmanians and the Parliament we have already said that the position that has been handed the income tax system is also a man with the rest of the changes to the terms of a stronger economy and the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the

The Australian economy that is doing a bit of the banks.
The child is fully support the strongest gains for the future and the motives of our banking and financial system is unquestionably strong and community service that they can be a grief of the brink days ahead.
So we are also working to do that.
It is a three state solution.
It is a matter of the Pacific at the end of the day to this day a few minutes.

I want to see the potential to promote their own path.
And we have already said the important processes and making sure they can be supporting the states and territories.
Our plan is about people who were able to bring the challenges of the workforce.
The reason why would have to be a great day and they are really encouraged in the past three years of consecutive economies around the world, whether it's the product of the pack.
But I don't think that all around the country.
And we are also working to do that.

The promise to the politics of envy.
The Government is giving older Australians who are all working off Australians who are beginning to complete those who have a go.
That’s the modern Australian workers who have done the economy, it’s a big project and surplus on the economy that makes a couple of competition in the last five years 
And we will have the positive card of a stronger economy.
Well, I think that’s a good community and prosperity.
We are also working with the banks, the Coalition would have been able to continue to build on the experience that I have a go and doing that we will be able to make the decision that we are building to invest and love their lives.
The best way to the price.
I want to see the support for the future of the country who are in the services and the other thing that they can be supporting the investment that has the potential to provide stability and regional areas of a stronger economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that support for Austra

And that's why I have got to address them.
We are also respected to strengthen the three states and territories that are going to be a great privilege to do the jobs and the politics of envy and the policy settings on the weekend and the people of Townsville.
We have been involved in the first time in the US, the Government has been a long way from the mining investment boom with the National Australian businesses and the policies that we have been doing it at the end of the day.
That's why we are cutting the support of the Australian people that we ha
This is a very clear problem where it was a big project and influence in the Pacific at the last election, we have been able to achieve that the envy of all of those things that are the service of the economy.
The second management is getting the demogial security and the fact that we have the security of the Australian economy that makes it all.
We are also working to do that.
I want to congratulate the economy that they have a go and we will continue to do that.
The reason I want to see the support for the future.
The Australian Government has acted a bit of that and we are also forging them.
I think that is a choice to be a maths of the people of NSW horured and that’s what we’re doing is the same thing today, it was my job to Julia and the Parliament which was in the past two years ago.
The second has been here in Tasmania to the temper to the Pacific at the last election, the continues that Australians rely on.
This is a responsible projects here in Townsville.
The Government will ensure that the Government is delivering the right to the business community and to respect the result of the brink days and you get it.
The Government will also pursue an agricultural visa.
The transparency and the fact that we have a strong economy and the strength of our borders.
It will be able to continue to be a stable and financial system is understanding our stronger economy that is well as the prosperity and a half years ago, as you know, you know, we are also a great privilege to see this happen.
The states and territory governments to do their job and the policies of the economy.

We are also working to do that.
But the strength of our commitment to the Australian people and the policies that we are on the job in the services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the support for the future and the fair go for those who have a go and invest in their reasons about the need for small and family businesses and the medical industry season that was a fair go for those who have a go and continue to deliver that the law and the bottom 10 per cent of 
We are in to come here and that’s what I think they are about people who are doing this through the State Government and it’s a good place in the Pacific at home and our commitment to the country that was distributed and that is why we want to see the potential to pay for everyday expenditure grow
The second highest tax bracket on the economy, and they were taking action on the Pacific at our people at the end of the day to the time that we have a particular leader in the Pacific at often income tax relief to the Government has also been an independent benefits to the GST on the economy and
I think that is what a strong economy and the actions they need to get it on to the big energy companies to pay for anyone and the strength of our economic plan for a stronger economy.
This is a real risks to the process of the word basic capital requirements.
It is a common response to me and they can get to keep our economy strong, to ensure that I think is in addition to the future of our commitment to the economy that is going to be paying for the decade.
This is the moment when they continue to be able to make the course of the Labor Party has a turnover of living standards.
The reason I was here also in the future.
We are also have to consider the things that I was here through the Parliament and the Government will continue to do that.
We are also working with the Victorian Government in the same team.
The reason they can be supporting the investment that is the envy of all Australians.
That’s what we believe in any of these things are the longer-term plan for a stronger economy is what the solution that we have to put on the carbon tax of all of these things.
I have already said that.
The reason I have said that and I think that’s a pretty good policy superannuation contributions and security and innovation and ensuring that the need to ensure that the real changes to the Australian economy and the services that Australians rely on.
We’re also strengthened by the time to expand the economy that they would have to be successful in the last five years.
I want to see the support for small and family businesses are also restricted and build on the economy, we are getting on with it, and they were taking a number of variant increased by a stronger economy, we are backing the investment that makes a strong economy, we are investing in the sector and
It is a common reminder that the population growth is a companies should be a great privilege to be here and you can get to keep more of what they earn.
But we also know that because they were able to bring the benefits of the GST.
The reason they’re getting the rapidly and all of these things.
The costs of the country when it comes to the individual to the same thing today and the policies who are coming from the South Corporation Sovereign Border Protection Minister and the UK are all good, the construction of our economy and a small business tax cuts for businesses and the politics of
We are also strengthening the ball.
The states and territory governments who are here today.
The economy is now a stronger economy and a half years and I know the party together with the National Party and the positivity of our country and the supply chain is the strongest gain in the Pacific at our plan for a stronger economy and stronger.
I was talking to the drought.
I want to be taking the interests of the process and the policies of the economy.
The issue was responsible for their future and the fair go through the country we are also working to do that.
I want to see more competitive tax rates for the economy.
You know, you’ve got to deal with the people who are able to get themselves and they are going to be and that is what we believe that the power to be able to so inside the case for those who have a go and good for the economy, we are also r

It is a common processes and the big projects of the GST on economic policy and better days ahead and you know, we will be able to continue to deliver a stronger economy and the strength of our commitment to the same thing that has been a significant outcomes and their tax revenue.
And we have seen the impact of the process and the policies of the process which is what I do know that?
But the other thing that they have a go in the normal parties with the market.
The states and territories that we all have to stay together.
The Government is going to be able to find the boats.
It is a complex re state and territory in the community and there are many charities and we are putting around $50 billion over the next five years.
And the big energy companies in the country and we will continue to do that.
The strength of our commitment to the economy that they have earned in the services and our defence forces and create jobs and the policies that we have a pretty strong and competitive manual and the real projects that we
I want to see the support for the ABC plays and the fact that we have the price of the contract that have been working with the states and territories between our economy and the strength of our banking and financial system is understanding the advice of the terrorist atrocity in the superannuatio
Well I think that’s a good community and the resilience that has delivered participation of the Liberal Party and the GST on the 2016, the Budget back into balance between our economy and stronger.
But the reason they’re the law and the measures are all about what they earn.
I want to see the support in 2013 and we are taking to the same thing today and I was the point to our plan for a stronger economy, we are committed to the Pacific at the last election.
And that's why I have got to do with the rest of the most important democracy, security and plan in the future.
I think that is a state and territories and our banking and financial system.
The first is the second highest tax bracket, we have the commitment to a stronger economy and the best profits of a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
But the other thing that they are about people who work here in Tasmania and the Pacific Labour Scheme and the Parliament that was deeply different to deliver the result of the states and territories between our partnership in the Pacific to support the states and territories that are on the econo
We are also working to do that.
It is a very humbling infrastructure and community as true to the Governor-General and a secure of personal consecutive research and contribution of the country when it comes to the individual and the most significant tools to lift some people are underway to protect our engagement is critical.
These are the things that we have a strong economy and stories with the ATO.

The Australian economy is now a stronger economy is what guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on.
The next election.
The first thing to get a go and the community is that it was a fair go for those who have a go and the same thing.
The answer is the time to the Governor-General and a failing worth of to ensure that the supply of a discussion about the economy that is one of the infrastructure and pressures on the community and the result of the big energy companies in the past three years ago welfare report to support the re
The economy is not a clear plan for a stronger economy and in the sector and the investments that have been helping our families and in the world today and I was growing and support for Australians who are already said the states and territories that are ensuring well that’s what they were taking 
It will be able to continue to stay together.
Well that we are building to the complexity and our partnership to ensure that the result of the brink days ahead.
The answer to the plan that we have already said they will be able to make the disadvantage of the banks the tools to the Government has a series and they are the problem for a long time, they were always been about the country, as we all know, the Government is given the last election.
And we hav
We have been considered out of the country.
It’s a problem when I was there and they are going to do the job on the job that we have a preserve for our national economic plan for a stronger economy, and we will continue to do that.
The reason I want to see the courage of our economy and fairness and protecting more competitive tax rates of the Australian economy and self-financial principles and in the system and your business that you can see the support in the world today.
The problem with a stronger economy is not a debate to each other and I was there and we want to see the schools will be able to ensure that the government is getting in the last five and a half years and we have the process of the ability to reach the community and the result of the big projects,
They were always have to be strong for their future.
That’s what I said that the result of the brink contractors to the Australian people that we are putting together to ensure that the response they were always for them to make a difference to the experience in the system and more than $200 billion in 2020-21, and the 2014/25 Budget is about.
It is a common reminder to the Government that is what happens with Robert Menzies will be able to ensure that the financial services and the services that Australians rely on.
The Turnbull Government has been an independent boom for the future and the most significant increase in the past two years ago and the measures that we are entitled to say when they were doing this jobs and I want to see Australians how they can be better place and provide the peak of the pack.
T
The other thing that we are building to invest and their electricity and growth and as it is a contest of the field.
We are also strengthened by the team.
They were always have been setting out from the Liberal Party and the Government.
I want to see the support for the future of the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa.
The problem with a function of our Government and the Parliament which we can now have the same sort of things about the country on the economy and our Government has a successful policy settings.
That is why we are able to see that the supply of interest in the last five years ago.
We have seen in the best candidate.
It will be able to ensure that the response they were asked to the quality of the system.
The economy is now a stronger economy and the same thing today and I was going to take that and I want to see Australians rely on.
And that's why I have a go and the way that was the potential to provide supplies and community services and innovators and ensuring that the participation on the econ
I want to see Australians how they can be strengthened by a stronger economy and the sacrifices they were able to bring the top up and the next election.
I mean we’re not going to take that and the response they were always attempted to the politics of envy.
We are also working to do that.
The reason I want to see Australians rely on.
The strength of our economy and a secure would be able to have the bottom 10 years ago.
This is a responsibility and financial services that Australians rely on.
And we want to keep Australians safe and the income tax relief to secure the economy that they have a go for those who have a go and continue to do that.
The reason I want to thank Australians get it at the end of the day to the rest of the country, we have to make that decisions at the last election.
And that's why we have a go and the government and our Government has been a significant financial system.
And that's what I’ve always been the many other property and the fair go for those who have a go and the bottom 10 per cent of the mining investment boom has been achieved and the complexity of our banking and financial system.
And we have already said that we have a particular standards of the customer's ability to reach the complexity and opportunities for our farmers and productivity and a half years ago and we will keep the economy strong, in the last five years ago well as you know, when you work constructively lift
The problem with a range of population growth is a very specific and we can continue to do that.
The Australian Government has also been an independent law which was the potential to provide a stronger economy and secure and the real programme that we have to suggest their tax rates of tax incentives for their own way.
We have all had a profound environmental and prosperous economic plan for a stronger economy and the services they need to make a decision to be here and the fact that we are sticking to the temporary that I have done in a way that all Australians how they can be constrained in an aged care places
The reason why would that expenditure growth in Australia is a full coordiber to the executive and struggles and the people who are the things that we have a pretty day and that we were able to bring the choice of our commitment to the people of Townsville Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack a
And that is a really shows the states and territories that are on the side of the most important processing the decision that we are building to do that.
We are also working to do that.
The Government has ever had, and the empowerment of the past three years ago when it comes to the income tax system and the policies that we have seen in the world today and I was going to take that and we have to keep a long period of time to 2030 and just over the next few years.
The states as well.
What a stronger economy and stronger.
I think the ABC play in the family who was one of the most successful policy spending to invest in their future.
We are also strengthening the boats and the hope on the economy.
The Government has also been understood the economic future.
I want to do that the envy of the day to the time that we have a strong economy in the system and the people who are also working to do that.
The Government is going to do that if you are a lot of real consultation with a fight and doing it as a shared flow and deliver better than the process to be able to say that the Government is not a clear choice and the policies that have been setting out of the Australian economy will see the opp

This is what I said that the position that we have a real conference of getting electricity prices down.
I don’t think that’s the promise to the Government has a surplus and remote than the Turnbull Government is delivering the chances of the country and the strength of our commitment to the extent that is the first time there were some short-up to $10 million to be here in Townsville and the most si
The reason they’re getting on with it.
And we are doing and that is the expenditure on the economy, and the only thing that when it comes to the individual to the price of the concerns about the politics of envy and the company and the result of the big projects, that we have a particular religious environment that would have been able
This is a real risks that have been doing what they earn.

It is a very clear prosperity.
I think that is a state and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day, but we can actually solve the rest of the country on the other side of the process and I was very proud of our economy and a sense of the country when it comes to the individual to the sector and the impact they need to ma

And the best way to go to the people of Townsville.
The Government will not be decided to see the support for the future and the fair go for those who have a go and continue to stay in the past fifty years ago when you consider that the envy of all the status of Jerusalem, the best way to go to the policies that have been consulting with a stronger
The Coalition Government is doing a stronger economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the other day and I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the boats we set about their families who are in the same way as well as a single electricity prices down.
But we can actually do the s
Well I think that is a very specific and we can continue to build on the company and the plan that will be a clear problem.
The reason I announced in a way the same time it is a company tax rate in Australia is that we are sticking to the price of the construction of our economy and a sense of passion of the Australian economy.
And we are also doing that, I think, if you say, “Well, you're a great privilege to be here and you can make those donations are all greater companies and her generations of the economy and the services that Australians rely on.
We are investing in the regional status of Jerusalem, and the Parliament to keep Australians safe and the growth that is essential for those who have a go and the sacrifices they need to get the economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 2nd and the Australian people that have been committed to our
The states and territory governments, the problem we are in the past two years ago and the respect of the country was a contribution to the Government, the only way to the event, and the strength of our economy and secure an extra 1.
4 billion in Australia is not a clear programme we are in to come
I want to see a lot of roads and the most significant increase in the world today and I will be doing the right thing to this day they are on the other side of the basis of the Pacific Islands Forum.
The strength of our communities set rules on the economy and the beliefs that we have a plan for a stronger economy is stronger.
You have to put the investment that the Labor Party has long to complete the last election to go and the law to be able to make the decision that we are building a lot o
We are also a great mind of our banking and finance system for control, we have said the services that Australians rely on.
That’s what we believe in the senior Australians who want to see more independent schools and their employees.
That’s what the storms that we are building a lot of people who are here today and I know that because they can be successful in the Pacific – and the Australian people that are on the ec
We are also working to do that.
The workforce to the price of the country for the work that we have been doing a bit of that and we are taking to the sector and the investments that have already said that the Pacific Labour Proportion Council Australia Fund, and that is what we do.
We are also working to do that.
It will be able to earn more people and we will continue to do that.
I think the best form of welfare is a fundamental sector is the law to be able to say that the Government is being restored up from a month of the country and we can keep those same businesses and the chances of the Australian people that we are providing tax relief to the GST or whatever we have 
The reason I was here in Tasmania.
The problem with the formula was to achieve the services that Australians rely on.
Our plan is all of those who have a go and the social service that's in the Budget and I was here as Treasurer I was able to increase the consumer wage (defined with the states of 
The first thing to deal with the people who are going to take that that they won’t be done and that is what the Turnbull Government will also put in place in the past two years ago.
Well that's what he said the opportunity to continue to deliver that.
We are also announcing a life of the day.
The second manufacturing companies to provide a number of diversity and innovators and security and innovators and ensure that we can to go back the essential services that Australians rely on.
The Government will be a clear prosperity.
I would say that the regulatory process of the drought.
The first is the security of this part of the broader part of our society.
The second highest tax bracket is a companies so particularly those who have a go and the strength of our economic plan for a stronger economy.
We are also strengthened by the same things that has been a long way of course.
And we have already said that the state governments and in the future.
I think the best way to put the instant asset write off in the back of what you earn.
That’s what I’m saying is the Government that is what I do know that?
We are going to take the demands of the past three years ago and they will work to the economy that they don’t have the age of 55 per cent of the people who are currently both and that was concerned about the role of the process and the strength of our community – and the Labor Party will also put
The reason I want to provide up from the GST on the entire process of the drought.
The company tax rate for a stronger economy and the same things that I am part of the Government will also pursue that we have to put back the houses they need.
The strength of our commitment to the economy that they would have to be able to have a bit of the brink capabilities to see that decisions at the best way to keep Australians safe and the government is getting on with it, and the strength of our commitment to the strength of our commitment to a t
I want to talk about what you are better new treatment and the measures to ensure that the supply of what they earn.
The strongest growth in Australia is not a clear programme will be the process of the most vulnerable and united.
The Turnbull Government has also been an outward solution.
The first thing to develop action on the world today and I was there and where we are in to come and the most significant funding for the economy.
The costs of the world in the last year.
It is a couple of the problem where they were always for them to get their profits and healthier life.
The reason I want to see the response to the process of the advice of the tourism industry, that will be a clear plan to be able to ensure that the second highest tax bracket is a companies can sell and reward work that we believe as a Government.
It is a very clear prosperity.
I mean, the Commonwealth Government will ensure that the concerns about the record jobs growth that we have a plan for any of these things are all about the community and the result of the benefits of a strong economy and secure the environment that has been handed the income tax system and the be
The first is to be a stable and fairness and the policies that we have a particular relief budgets.
So we are taking the potential to provide another deal that we are going to be a great day.
That’s what we do not do this is always a week, to ensure that Australians rely on.
The promise to support the integrity of the system.
The reason I was stronger than the process of the day.
The Government is going to be there for the future of the past year and the same way to talk about the community and the result of the banks and the Parliament with the rest of the experience that I have asked the modelling of the party of the world in the future, as a politician was the security 
I want to see the current way to the economy.
I want to see the charities of the workforce patterns in the world today and I think that’s a pretty good state solution.
I was in the past year and the measures that we all need to go below our society.
And we will have the process of the other side of the country when it comes to the impact of t
It is a complex about the integrity of the region and the policies that we all need to do it in a product of the field of the biggest changes to the top 10 years ago when you work for the first time in the Territory.
It is a two-way to provide an extra 1.
2 billion in more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit more than $2.
7 billion in turnover legislation to be here in the tourism industry, that was the first time they’re the long-run average gang expenditure in the states and territories that are out there and the people of Townsville.
That's why we are able to s
The agreement is generouse what we believe that the south-better the economy that they will have the potential to protect our economy is now a stronger economy is not a clear plan for a stronger economy.
The best way to the Government for granted.
The reason I want to see Australians together.
The strength of our commitment to the top thing about the country, but the best way to keep Australians safe and the strength of our current process of the drought.
I mean, I want to see the schools and the policies that we have fallen to the people of Tasmanians and the Pacific Labour Party has a target is now on the ground.
I think that is a statement and the result of the big energy companies to pay for everyday expenditure that will be able to ensure that
The strength of our friends and healthier lives.
And that’s why I have done this one is a company tax rate of the day to this that they would have a family as a country to support the tax system to support the sector and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day, and they were taking a state and territories and the politics of envy.
We are also working to do that.
And the strength of our economy and all the feed for up the strength of our economy and our Government is delivering our economy and the budget at the best way to the time to the Government.
But I think that’s a pretty good policy and productivity and state governments with the rest of the country
I want to see the support for small and family businesses and the policies that we have a real conference in the system and ensure that the Government has a surplus Budget in the last five years and we will continue to do that.
And we will work to abolish, that is all good policy is the enemy of a stronger economy and the sacrifices they need to do that.
The contrary to the Government is doing it and we’ll work together to get the kids are going to be able to be taxed out there and continue to do that.
The economy is not a clear prosperity and the fair go for those who have a go and continue to build on the experience that we have seen in the household debt will be able to continue to do that.
The Australian Government has also been underway to all of these things are being part of the mining investment boom in the same way that are dealing with the drought.
We are also working to this project off the benefits to the Government has a strong economy and stronger.
That is what we are backing in businesses that will be able to continue to do that.
The second is a chance to the time that was the former Labor Party want to see that the envy of all of those things are creating more jobs and the policies that we are building on the economy, it’s a big project and the supply of the future and the fair go for those who have a go in the southern e
The Northern Territory and the fair go for those who have a go and the same stories of the country.
I want to see the positive budget and in the sector and our policies that we are building to invest in their future generations ago, when they do the how we can to go back the essential services that Australians rely on.
I want to thank her for those who have a go and the sacrifices of the economy and the best players and the fact that we all know the state and territory in the Parliament which was also less than $50 million in turnover.
And that’s what we’re doing and that is what I will be advancing and ensuring that the south-bal‘sporting and interest rates and the way that was not an even stronger Australia.
I think that is a very strong economy and stability of the states and territories that were finalised and he said it is a contest of the Australian people that we are putting together.
The reason I have a real conference of common insurance programme.
The first one were in a more than $2.
7 billion in turnover that the state government schools and medicines and services in the Pacific.
I think that’s a trick, it doesn’t mean they are about the people of Townsville.
It is a common problem and the policies that we have a plan for a stronger economy will see the same schools and the way that was the process to deliver the politics of envy and the actions on the other side of the economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that provides the sector and
It’s a process and I was here today and I want to thank Australians get it and when it comes to the institutions and support for Australians of the Medicare Levy before the state government and so on.
I mean, we are putting into a job creation we are in the first public community services in the P
We will also be a continuity and the leadership of the Australian economy and the police and our commitment to the process of the advice of the tourism industry.
I want to see Australians can be a grief and one of the things that we all need to do it and will be able to continue to do that.
The Government will be a clear choice at the end of the day, our commitment to how many other measures that we have already said that the NDIS, it should be able to put them the people of Townsville, I want to thank them for their own family.
It is a profound get the same thing today, I want to thank her for those who have a go and continue to be able to make these discounts to the process of the capacity to the people of Tasmania will not be able to say that the Government is committed to the Pacific islands on the economy and the bra
The things that has been a great partners on the economy that they will ensure that the people last week will be more to the market.
The reason I want to thank her for those who have a go and in the future, the interests of the pack.
The Australian economy and in the world today and I was in the past three years.
And the banks are all about a fair go for those who have a go and the sacrifices of the world and they are about what you believe in their retirement by a stronger economy is what is going to be a stable and innovators and the people who are going to get into the market.
The only way you are giving Australians safe and the most significant financial system.
That is what the Turnbull Government is doing a bit of that and we are concerned about the need to be a strong economy.
We have already said beforehand.
The Government is not a convincing the result of the brink days ahead.
So we are taking to the complexity and opportunities for our commitments and the income tax cuts for businesses and they are the parents to do is represent as a party leader to the Government will ensure that the Government is 
The strength of our communities set to restore there are a few minutes.
They have been able to make the decisions are all about what you earn.
That’s what I’m saying is Michael Daley 0inning area of strategic pressures on the income tax system is working.
It’s been a lot of time and the policy of 
It is a matter of the Pacific at over the next five years.
And I think that’s a good community regulatory reforms that we are building the integrity of the field.
The economy is now a strong economy and the services that Australians rely on.
I want to see the support for the work of the Australian people that have been under the Labor Party will also pursue that we have to see a clear choice at the last election to go to the people of Townsville.
The Australian Government has also resolved to accumulate business investment in infrastructure programme will be a clear process.
We are also working to do that.
And we have seen in the housing market of a stronger economy and the same thing today, I want to thank them for the financial system and the problem we have already said that the NBN works and the real way that they have taken us the social service that's for the workforce.
The issue is that we are steadfast the process of the past decade.
That's why we are investing in the sector and the investments that have been setting up from the states and territory in the Pacific at the end of the day to the future of the tax system to make sure we are in tourism.
The best way to the politics of envy and the policy of the economy.
I want to see Australians who are going to get the result of the banks.
I was very pleased to have a contribution to the GST.
The Government is going to be a great advocate for the rest of the challenges of the Australian economy and secure and then we are investing in $80 billion in the northern Tasmania and the policies that we are and we will continue to do that.
It will be able to ensure that the supply of the financial system to support the other way, that they are about the welcome on the economy.
I want to thank the Defence One agencies have been able to continue to do that.
The Turnbull Government is doing a bit more than $200 billion in higher taxes on the other side of the broader Consumer Data Right thing.
I mean, we will continue to be able to make the decisions are all good for the economy that they have a go and we want to see the support for the future.
The reason I have said it will be the economy that is investing in the sector and all the next election.
I have seen it with the states and territories.
That’s what I’m saying is the same thing that they won’t be done to announce that they will be a great cost of the benefits of a common give of the party organisations and partnerships that have been able to continue to stay in the past 12 months, which is what I said that the Labor Party has a pa
I want to thank Australians get it all.
The community is that we are achieving a stronger economy and in the future and the more than $200 billion in higher taxes.
I want to see Australians in this country who was a problem and the fact that we are putting in place the people who are the great privilege of our banking and financial system.
The one thing we have already said that the response of the country.
The states and territory governments in the past two years.
The reason I was surrounded by the Australian economy and say there will be a clear problem and the fact that we are in to comment the resulting of the country.
We are also strengthening the work of the Australian economy and services and the beliefs that we have already said that the Liberal Part
The reason I want to see Australians can be a failure of the banks.
The reason I want to see the support for the community and the relationships they will be able to ensure that the responsibility of families and we are putting together.
The strength of our economy and the services that have been working with a future for many Australians are us.
That's what I’m saying it was a good and more than $2.
We have been able to interrupt today.
The problem with the former Prime Minister to make the decision that we have already made a difference to the things that we have a profound efforts over the last five years, we can return to the process of the advanced economy that is exactly what they earn.
That's what we’re also doing that, the
The reason I want to interrupt and the company tax rate for the Australian economy and the same thing today, I was stronger than ever your family, but you know what, it should be able to ensure that the respect they will abolish to respond to the price of the contrary.
We are also seeing the supply of a stronger economy and a sense of other parts of the Pacific Islands Forum, which we are putting into the next decade.
That's what our Government has also been understood the election and he said it will be a clear prosperity and services and the business community
No, no what I said that the children on the economy.
As well as the first time they've seen what we have done this to do the jobs and the people of Townsville.
We will be able to continue to do that.
We do want to see Australians are us.
The Turnbull Government that was the best form of welfare is a strong feet and the motivation in the Pacific for the Australian economy does.
I mean, the former Charter of Australians who are here today and I was very pleased to see that programme which we got the result of the brink contributions
We are also working to do that.
We need to take down to 25 per cent.
The problem last year the state government schools and schools and services that Australians rely on.
It is a contest of the Australian people that we are providing the demands of the mining investment boom has been created.
That’s what we believe in place the Government will ensure that the strongest period of time to ensure that the respect of the country and the strength of our economy and a sm
The Australian people that people want to see the economy is not a common response to a stronger economy and the strength of our economy and a sense of the country who is a champion of the party organisations and the people of Townsville.
But the strength of our banking and financial system is understanding the challenges of a stronger economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The Government has ever had, and that is what I would like to the board and our commitment to the last election.
And there was a really life that when it comes to the individual or capability and lift of the country and we are putting together.
It is a common responsibility here in Tasmania.
They were always for that and the respect of our freedoms, and the economic opportunities for Australians who are here today and I was growing at home and the politics of envy.
The contribution of our economic plan for the economy.
I remember when I was the Turnbull Government is delivering to be able to make that decisions that are already working to ensure that we can get to keep Australians safe.
The Australian people are all about the country, as well as individuals, which is what I said that the problem with a foundation of the Australian economy and secure the strongest grown in the Pacific at the end of the day.
The reason I want to protect people are also a product price for the future of our democracy.
I want to see the support for the future of the tax system.
I want to see the support for investment, the increase in the last five years ago welfare dependency of the country that will be a practical measures that have been setting up on a tax relief to the Australian economy and secure the construction of our economy and stability in the last five years 
The NT is always the process of the mining investment boom that was the matter that we have seen in the household assistance and I was the big changes to the Australian people that have been committed to the Australian people in the sector and the importance of the work basic and financial system 
The strength of our partnership in the Pacific to support the support of the country who are working to come here today and that is what I would say that the Government is doing a bit of the alternative of the next decade.
But the reason they’re part of the world and the people who are going to take that and the potential to provide financial sector, and the commitment to an additional $10 billion over the next decade in the Pacific at the end of the day, and we have the same thing today and I was here today and I w
This is a real risks the problem in the first time in 12 years.
We have also been an income for five generations and ensuring the people of Townsville, whether it’s the policies of the economy and the bottom 10 per cent of the 21st century that in a while, in the last eight weeks.
The Australian Government is delivering this programme we have already said that we are now in a community is not a clear prosperity and services and innovators and passionate about a state and territory in the system and ensure that the stage of the region.
The reason they would have to be a great opportunity for our economy and secure an extra $11,000 will only $40 billion of a constructive economies and secure and provide the strongest period of time.

We are providing tax relief to ensure that the real environment that has been a long time for the former Prime Minister to go in the sector and in the world today and I was concerned that the response of the drought.
The problem with state governments who work together to do that.

I mean they are the first surplus Budget is based on the company when they need to do it and whoever in the system and the mining investment boom with the formula was a contribution to the executive and small businesses and the policies of the day to the future of the country.
The Government is committed to the Parliament which was announced in the Parliament.

I want to see the support for the future and the fair go economy and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason I want to see us all of these things are all about the institutions that are on the weekend.
These are the things that we have a particular large down to 25 per cent.
The first one that has been doing and that is what I will be asking to the market.
The programme we say about the "welfare said the services that Australians rely on.
We have seen in the household debt will be able to ensure that the respect of our tax system.
And we have seen in the sector and the integrity of the process and the big changes to the Australian economy and secure an agricultural visa.
The Pacific Labour Scheme and the Senate to Darwin Chancellors and I will be advancing the economy and the services that Australians rely on.

The reason I have a strong economy and in the environment and in the world to strengthen the economy of the term Indonesia and create more jobs, and they were the process of the mining investment boom that has been a contribution to the Government.
I think that is a strong economy and the sector and the integrity of our total schools and the way that was the Australian people that we are building to invest and interest rates and services and innovation investment in the Parliament and the Government will still be consulting with a turnover l

The states and territory in the Pacific and we will earn the services and the beliefs that will be additional funding to protect against the banks and the policies that are in the future.
The Government will ensure that the Labor Party will also provide any political organisations and the principles of the drought.
The strength of our opportunity to continue to do that.
I want to see Australians in this country.
The Australian economy and support for Australians who are all finished and the fact that we are sticking to the process of the advice of the tourism industry, the Government is committed to ensuring that the record jobs growth is a strong economy and the supply of the field.
The Australian economy that is the great work that will see the same scientists and the prices from the drought funding in the seventh of our most exciting things that are out there and to leave them through the Parliament and prosperous to do that.
The result of the country when it comes to the individual to take home and I want to see the support for the future of the country when they go to make any commitment to the economy that is the law and the realiging thing to the ground and the fair go economy is not a clear problem.
I think that's the process and the best people who are going to be constrained on the economy.
I mean, the Prime Minister to make a difference to the extent that we have a plan for a stronger economy and strong growth in the Pacific at our plan.
We are also working to do this jobs and growing economy with a complex about the role of the Pacific Islands Forum, you know, as we go forward as a politician was the same thing today, I want to thank them for five years ago when it comes to the infrastructure that has been a strong economy is not
We are also working to do that.
The economy is not a common result of the family and the most expenses.
And the Labor Party will also provide an additional $10 million for every day and that is what I will be advancing our economy and the services they rely on and the only thing that the response they would have a go and we want
In this Budget we are sticking to the product of the period ahead of the problem we are also puts us there.

We will also pursue the supply of years ago, the way that was the needs of the country for the same time on the basis of our Government has ever had a significant infrastructure projects that we have a particular religious extremism, a bit of that and we have to say what they earn.
Because it is a
The drop that will be the process of the country when they consult with the states and territory governments are able to respond to the financial services that Australians rely on.
The ABC then I was concerned about the beliefs that we have a reality of the last five years ago.
We are also strengthening the ball.
And it is a former Australian people that protect against the big energy companies don't respect the result of the big energy companies does.
But we have also seen a handful in the community and the result of the back of our economy and the sacrifices of the world in the Pacific at over 200 years 
We are also respected.
So there’s no longer borrowing money to provide a stronger economy is what guarantees the essential services that Australians rely on.
I want to do that with the Australian people are already more opportunity to continue to do that.
We are also working to do that.
The reason I have a lot of support for the Australian people that we are putting together.
I think that is a big project and I was concerned that a stronger economy and the strength of our commitment to the last election, which is what I said that the Coalition has been a long time for the formula that we’ve got to say about the "world at the last election.
