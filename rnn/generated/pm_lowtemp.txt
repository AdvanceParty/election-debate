I mean, the Labor Party who are in the country, to see that in the country.
They are the same thing.
I think that is going to have to see the same thing.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see them to be able to stop the country to the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world.
The Labor Party has been a champion of the community to come to Australia.
The program which was abominable where the process we’re going to have to see the same strength of the laws that we are in a position to be able to deal with the states and territories and the best place to see the same strength of the support that I have no place to the point that we have to be a
They will be able to do that and I think it is about the future.
It is a community that we are in the baseline of the Australian people are going to be able to start the choices that we have the policies that are being provided and assistance to those who have been selected and the economy is stronger, that will be a tradie for seven years.
I mean, the Coalition doesn't have a plan to make a comment on that and the strength of our communities.
The first thing that is going to be able to pursue in a surplus Budget in the world today.
I mean, the first thing that we are investing in the community and the other thing that has been a great team you will be able to start the challenges that we have to be able to deal with the states and territories who were so created as a result of the migration programme of the congestion-bustin
The reason we had to stop you the interests of the world.
That's what we said that the Labor Party that we are doing and that's what the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been setting on these issues that are in the biggest regions which we have to do to take on these issues that are serviing that the Labor Party wants to punish the b
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the boats come and be sent up there for the Central Coast and the most serious of the great work that is supporting the borders and the most prosperous country and the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
The program which was the process of the country and they have a responsible target that we have been able to be done with the State Government that we have been doing it with the process we’re going to get on site and the support we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
I mean, I think that is a very simple of demand that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about connecting on the social cohesion of our communities that are all around the country and the economy that we have seen the same thing.
It’s a plan that will have to do that.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to put $200 billion in the future.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the standing border protection framework with the state government to take on these issues that are in the biggest regions which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with t
That's why I think that will be able to stop the states and territories and the people smugglers would be able to provide the support we have been doing with the choices that we are in a position to be able to start the challenges that we have to do that and I think that will be able to stop the s
That's what we said it was a long list thing that we have seen the system and the best of Australians and the Labor Party wants to put it and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the first thing that we have the process of the country and the Labor Party who want to commen
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the border protection and the economy is stronger than they would be able to stop the country on the Central Coast, they have the investment in the country.
The Labor Party has been a great time of the property.
They are already delivered and the support we were going to be able to get on with the infrastructure that we have to do that and the strength of our communities.
That is what we’re doing is that we can add to that point.
The Labor Party has been a really important project and the strength of our communities together and all those years ago and I want to thank all of these places like that the social media companies and the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
The process of the last five and a half years and I did this is the process we’ve got to say that the comments of that is the story of the passionate to the country in the world today.
The process will be able to go and that is what we’re doing is we were first to our policy of the last five and a half years ago, the project and the strength of our communities that are in the election will be able to do that and we are the lights of a reckless emissions targets by 2030.
Well that's what we have to do that.
They are all sort of supposition and the same thing in the country.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country and the Labor Party when they were in government, the support that I have to pay for the choices that we have been able to be doing it and the money in the Parliament to make sure that their properties and the peop
I mean, the work that is going to be able to pursue the country and the Labor Party wants to get around about the projects and we are the victims of today.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take it to the extensive thing to do that and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to give them the comments of that is the same thing to do to take on these issues that we are in a position to stand up there in the Parliament and that w
They have already been a great job for the work that is going to be able to stand up in North Queensland in terms of what they earn.
The reason we have to do that and the same thing for the Australian people are going to be able to start businesses and that was the former Prime Minister and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be done on the southern years ago and I want to thank all of those who
I mean, the first thing that is the same thing for the Central Coast, but also to be here with you.
The problem I have a very clear choice; a series of the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the state government to deliver on that in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago.
The minimum wage is that the Labor Party wants to take it to the extension capability of Australians that we are acting on that basis.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who are here today and I think the independent assessments with the state government to support the results, which is a commercial basis.
That's what we said that the Labor Party wants to get around about this.
I mean, the state government to deliver on the strength of our borders stronger.
That's why we have seen the incentive to go to the Minister for Immigration Minister and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be the case that we are taking on the strength of our borders and a strong economy is so critical to the Thai Government and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the first thing that we are investing 
It is a community that we have the process of the country and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been a state of what they earn.
It is a comprehensive procurement and the other thing we had to stop you here in Western Australia.
The process we have been able to get on site.
That's what we have a plan to make a comment on that and the security that we have the process we’re going to put the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party has been a real session of the day.
It is a community that has been a great team you will do it in the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they will be able to start payments a
I want to thank all of those who have been able to be done and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the people smugglers will be determined by the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of 
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the team to see that and they are here today.
The problem I have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
We have a plan to manage population growth and the financial system and the same policy of welfare processing and the support we’re investing in the team and the consoler that we have the policies that are all around the country.
The program which was a community that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are being put in place the lessons of this country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to 
Well it’s all about the project and we have a plan to make a contribution to make sure that their property by putting the projects that we are in the biggest reform.
We will continue to do that and the same policy of weeks ago, that was the only thing that is going to be able to stop the economy that we’ve been doing it with the state government in the same way that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people and they are all about the projects tha
I think that is a very difficult times.
That is what we said we were going to be able to get on site and the same thing that we have to stop you the one we're now going to be a real choice and they will be able to stop the construction in the world today.
It is a decision I was down in Tasmania.
I mean, the first thing that we are investing in the community and the legislation that we are investing in the community and the other thing that we have been doing working together with the state government to see the same strength of the economy that we’ve seen in the Budget and the Labor Party
The program which was able to actually halve the same thing about the impact of his own parts of the country.
The Labor Party has done in the economy.
That is the thing I think that is going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the best of Australians of the Year.
I think that is a very special group of people who are here today and to be here with you today and the first thing that we have been doing it without the case in terms of what they earn.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to thank the Commonwealth Government that we are investing in the country.
That's what we saw it on the advice of the Australian people and they will be able to provide the support that I have no place to the work that is being done on the economy.
I mean it was a long list of all the time to see the same thing.
It is a fair go for those who have been a real sessed of the Australian people have been doing to the Australian people have been setting on the southern part of the country and the fact that they will continue to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process of the country and she has done it by taking a number of partnership on the Central Coast, they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party who have been selected and the state government in the same way that the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Liberal Party a
The Labor Party has been a great choice and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason we have seen the same since we came to government, they have already been a great job for a wage rise on the science and the state government and the economy that we have to do that.
I mean, the state government was a community to the country to see that in the country.
The process we are the victims of the country and the Labor Party who will be doing it and they will be able to do that and the strength of our communities that are providing that process.
I was down in Tasmania.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about the future of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the economy is stronger than they were last in power to the work that is also about co
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to make the decisions that are all around the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to start paying down there and they have the pressures of the world.
I think that is a very strong position on this issue and the people to go forward to the future.
The Government has achieved in the Budget and I have no place to the people of Townsville and the people smugglers will be determined by the President of the Year.
The contrast, the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities.
I mean, the first thing that I have the population growth and the state government to take on these issues that are all around the country.
They have already put in place.
That's what we saw it on the other side of the mainstream parties down.
It is a danger to the Labor Party wants to get on site and the same thing.
Well thank you very much for that and the support we have been doing and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party that is necessary to the surplus we've been doing.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to give them a great job for a long time.
I mean, the first thing that we are in the biggest regions which is going to be able to stop the country to deliver on the strength of our economy and the support we were going to be able to stop the states and territories who are here today and the strength of our communities.
That is what we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be able to start businesses and they will be able to stop the rest of the world.
That is what we are also very consistent with the states and territories and the response of the Australian people are allowed to be able to deal with the states and territories who are here today.
They have already been a great job for the great work that we have been able to be done on the economy.
I think that is a commitment to the country to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I want to thank you for the work you've done in the Parliament and that was the problem that we have the policies that are all around the country.
I don't think there are many things about the future.
The program which is going to be able to do that and the same thing to do that and the strength of our economy and they are actually doing a surplus Budget in the world today and the Labor Party who have been able to be doing it and they are the survivors through the Parliament and that was the pr
It is a danger to address the country that we have the policies that are in the biggest reform.
I mean, the first thing that we have been selected and the same thing to do that and the strength of our plan to manage population growth is also about connecting on the states and territories and the legislation that we are investing in the infrastructure that we are the victims of the country an
The Labor Party has been a great team you will be an absolute disgrace, they have already made a few weeks ago.
The program which was actually in the community and the other thing we're putting into the Parliament and that will be a real spirit of this site of the mining industry and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party that we are in a position to be able to pursue in a reckless emission
The program which was able to actually have to be addressed.
The problem I have set out there and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the process we’ve been doing and that is the biggest reform.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
The Labor Party has seen in the Parliament and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re going to be able to stop you the interests of the world.
That is what we have a plan to manage population growth and the consoler of the Australian people have been doing that and they will be able to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are allowed to be able to deal with the states and territories and the Labor Party who want to see the s
I mean, the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stop the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the people smugglers see the same thing for the Australian people who are here.
The real choice between the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been doing with the states and territories and the project and the services are already delivered and the security that we have been selected and the same thing is the states and territories and they are the need for
The Labor Party has been a great time and the consoler of the Australian people have been able to bring the Budget back into surplus, then we can always do and the Labor Party and the Labor Party who have been selected and the strength of our success in the future.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party, which is what the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they have the strength of the economy.
And that's why I think that is a very clear contrast, they are of the moment is the transfer of people who are here.
That's what we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are actually what the Labor Party wants to get on site.
I mean, the first thing that I think is the same thing.
The process we are the victims of the country and the economy that have been serving in the Parliament and that will be a tremendous cost of disrespect of women and the support that we are actually had to start construction in the world today and the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days from
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the best place to see the same street every single day and the laws are the ones that we have to be able to do that and I want to thank you for the work that I would ensure that they would be doing it and they will continue to deliver on the strength of our com
The first thing that we have a plan to meet our 2030 targets and the support we were first elected and the independent assessments have been selected and we will continue to deliver additional counsellors and the people of Townsville and the state government has been a great team you will do it in
They will continue to do that.
The reason we have a plan to meet them at the heart of what we saw that the opportunity to come to Australia and our plan to manage population growth is all about.
Well that's what we said that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
So that’s what the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stop the construction in the world today.
I think that’s the process of the country and it will be a policy that we have to do that.
The problem I have a go.
I think that is a very difficult in this country.
That’s why I say to them all today.
They are all sort of projects and we are acting on that and the other thing we had to make them afford it.
The congestion-busting infrastructure and the same thing to do to the same thing.
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be a police officers and they will be determining that those who have been doing to the Australian people.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the transfer of people who are here.
It is a community that has been a great team you will do it.
That's what we're doing is that the Labor Party who are all about the project and the support we have been doing this and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
That's what the Labor Party wants to get it to the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities that are actually taking a hit more to say that the program that we are investing in the infrastructure that we are going to be done on the economy.
They are standing with the state government to ensure that we can actually do the same thing.
They are all sort of projects and they are going to be able to get the bill that we have the point where we will continue to do that.
It is a community that we are investing in the community to deliver on the Australian people are already dealt with and that was the problem with the states and territories and the state government to deliver on that in the future.
I think that is a very clear choice; a great thrill between the Labor Party wants to get into the regions we've got a strong economy and they are the future and the other thing that is going to be able to do that and the strength of our communities that are in the medical professionals are already
That is what we said we were able to get on site and that is what the police have been selected and the people of Townsville and the most streat and more of what they earn.
I want to thank the Australian people are allowed to be able to provide the support we have been able to be done on the southern years ago, that was the process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories a
I think that is a very clear contrast, but there's a lot of the local environment and the strength of our plan to manage population growth and that will be a truly to that stage is a process that is designed to see the same thing for the Australian people are going to be able to start businesses a
The Labor Party has been a great time and the consultation will be able to stop the country to be able to deal with the states and territories and the strength of our communities where we will be doing it and they are already delivered and the services that Australians rely on.
They are all stepped on this issue and that is what the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to start the decisions that are all around the country.
I want to thank you for the work that is the strength of our success of the country.
The plan that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country to the Labor Party who want to see the same thing about the project and the strength of our communities.
The Labor Party has seen it with the state government to deliver on these issues.
That's what the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days and they are all about the projects that we are in a position to be able to deal with the state government to take on these issues that are providing that as well.
Well there's a lot of the local community and the other thing that we have to do that.
It is a community that we have the policies that are being realised to the rest of the world.
The process we have been able to be able to pursue in a reckless emissions targets by 2030.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to see an additional $11 million in the world today and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and that will be able to come and a strong economy is that the Labor Party that we have to be able to stop the decisions that we have
That is what is a fair go for those who have been able to be able to go on to the practical projects and the tax system to see that and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the state government to see that the cooperation to the same sort of vehicles that we have to be add
I think that is a commitment to that is the advice of the Australian people are going to be an enormous amount of the comments of this and the legislation that we've been doing that in the Parliament and that is the process we’re going to take a couple of days from the last five and a half years a
Well thank you very much for the way that they will be doing it and they are all sort of money on the Central Coast and the economy is exactly what they are already talking about the project and the technology that we have to do that and the same thing for the Labor Party who want to see the same 
The Labor Party has been a really important part of the world.
The process of the country and the services that Australians rely on.
The first thing that the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago, that was the only way to the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the strength of our economy stronger and the economy is stronger, when I was the same thing to see that and the only way to do that and I
The process we are today.
The million dollars we have the project and the support we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, but I want to thank you for the work that is necessary to take action on the Central Coast, they will be able to start the
That is what we’re doing that and they have already been a great job for the work that is driving themselves and they are already has been a great team you will be able to deliver on the strength of our communities together and they have the strength of our communities together and they will have 
They are all sort of projects and they will be able to start businesses and they will be able to stop the record of the day and I think that is a commitment to the country to the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
Well the Labor Party who want to see them and they would have to be able to start payments and they are already delivered and the services that Australians want to see the same thing for the future.
The congestion-busting infrastructure investments in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get on site and the state government in the state government to be here with the state government to be here with the states and territories who are here today.
I mean, I was here at this election, the only way to the point of the great work that we have been doing to the lowest level since we came to government and that will be a part of the world.
That's what they were in government that we are doing and that will cost how the Australian people are going to be able to pass you there's an uncanny community that we have a plan to manage money.
That is a very important part of the country and they will be able to stop the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the strength of our economy and the legislation that we have to do that.
I mean, the first thing that we are in the biggest regions which we have to be realist.
That's what we said that the Labor Party who have been able to do that and the same policy that we have to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, in the seat of Lingiari and New Zealanders and the Labor Party who have been able to be done on the economy, the strength of our communities together and they have the population growth and the economy is stronger.
They will be able to get the border protection framework with the state government in the same way that we can add to that and the economy is stronger than what the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's what we are the standard of this week, we will make the decisions that we have seen in the Budget back into balance.
They have already been a reminder on the sort of vehicle you have to be able to do that and the state government to ensure that they were in government and the economy is exactly what they earn.
It was about the future.
I think that is a very strong position on the Central Coast, but we all know what that means it is about the project and the strength of our communities.
I mean, there are many things that are all around the country.
The first thing I think that is a very clear contrast, the story of the world.
That is what we can actually do that.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing we had to stop that and we've got a strong economy.
They have already set out to be here with the states and territories from the Parliament and that was the process of the country and they have the pressures that are being here today and that was the process of the country and it will be a key part of our country.
It is a community that we have been able to be done with the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities that are being here today and they will be able to do that and the state government in the same way that they will be able to get the best for young people and they have been
The process we’re now backing the borders.
The first thing that they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to provide the support we have to do that.
And the last four office in the country.
The million dollars we have been doing to the Australian people are going to take a couple of days from the Australian people.
And the other thing that he has to be done on the economy.
I was down in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago.
The policy that I will be standing for the Australian people are going to make them afford to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the strength of the economy and they have the pressures of the world.
That is what we said we were going to be able to go to the work of the Australian people are going to take a couple of weeks ago.
The program which was the process of the country and the economy is stronger than they play the state government to be here with the state government to take on these issues that are already dealt with the state government to deliver on the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the
The first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about policies that are here today.
The program which was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get behind the borders of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party has seen it with the states and territories and the best place to see the same thing for the future.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing that we have seen in the Parliament and that will be a truly to make their communities are going to be able to stop the state government to deliver on the basis of people who are all about the projects that are being here to be here with th
The only wages on the basis of the country and the economy is stronger than what they can do that.
I mean, the thing I love about how they need to be a recognition of the Labor Party that we are investing in the community and the other thing I think that will continue to do that.
The reason I am announcing that and the economy is stronger than they were in government and the economy is extraordinary.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the National Security Committee of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the thing I love about the project and the strength of our communities together and they have already been a great Australian of the Labor Party wants to put the truth and the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities that are in the biggest regions that are all around
I mean, the Labor Party who have been going to be able to come here to be here with you and they will be able to provide the support that we have the project and they are already delivered and the support we have been doing that and they are here today.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who are all sort of projects and they will be able to deal with the state government to take on these issues that are all around the country.
I mean, I think there is a lot of these communities.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to start businesses with the State Government has achieved in the future and the economy is stronger was to have a strong economy and the strength of our economy is stronger, that we have been able to be done on t
The process of the country and the Labor Party says they have the policies that are going to be a tremendous cost of disrespect of women and the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
And there are no transferees of the country.
That is a very significant issue in place.
But the other thing I think that is a very clear choice; because they don't have a problem that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party wants to see that and the support we were first to our country.
The process we have been able to be done on the economy, as we have seen in the Parliament and that we are acting on that basis.
The first thing I think the right thing to do that and we are in a position to be able to do that and the same sort of people who are going to be done on the weekend and the Labor Party who have been able to get on site and the state government to take on these issues that are all around the count
And that's why I don't think there are many things we need to do that and the legal force of that process.
The process of the country and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
I think that is a very clear contrast, but the policy that we have a plan to meet them to the people of Townsville and the strength of the economy and the people of Townsville and that will continue to do that.
The first thing that is going to be able to do that and the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities that are serving to the lessons of this project and the support we have been doing as a local member.
They have already seen in the Parliament today.
The reason why we are in a position to be able to go on and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people have been able to do that and the strength of the economy.
That's what we said we would never again, the technology that is being done on the interconnector of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put into the regions which we have a plan to manage population growth and the state government to deliver on the strength of our economy is supporting t
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see the same thing for the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories from the horrific event that we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first thing that I convened the Budget back into balance.
It is a community that we have to do that.
It is a community that we have been doing to achieve it as a result of the projects that we have been able to support the record of the surf lifesaving of our cities and the legal force of that and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are i
That is what we are able to stop the economy that we are in a position to be able to stand up in North Queensland and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
This is a process that was pretty excited about the projects and we're committed to the state government to deliver on the strength of our economy and they have the policies that are being here today and the strength of our communities that are being realised.
The Labor Party has been a really important project and the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
Well that's what we're doing is that we were in a position to be able to stop the system and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put it in the Budget back into balance.
We will continue to work with the states and territories who are out there and they are here today and they will be able to do that and the state government to deliver on that and the opportunity to deal with the choices that have been serving that the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into
They have already been a great success of the decisions that we have to get the budget back into surplus, the fact that they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the strength of the economy if they have already been a great job for the great work that we have been able to be do

There is no suggestion that we have been doing to the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world.
I mean, I think the independent assessments are going to be done on the economy.
The process we have been doing that and the same thing to do to the day and they will be dealing with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the strength of our success of the country.
That was the thing I think that is a very clear contrast, as we know it and the state government to deliver on that and the opportunity to be able to get on site and the independent process for the Australian people are going to be done on the economy.
I mean, the way that the Labor Party wants to get around about it and they are the future and the people smugglers would be able to deal with the states and territories who are here.

The million dollars’ as well and the process we’ve been able to get on site and the same thing is the story of the world.
The Labor Party has been a great Australian Navy and I have no interest in the future.
It’s also about the project and as a result of the impacts to make sure that their own economies are going to be able to get on site and the support we were first elected and the recovery and the safety of Australians that are already taking a fact that they would have to be able to get on site.
And that's why we have to do that.
It is a very difficult times like the one we're going to have to prevent the comments are already has been a great Australian Navy is a very clear choice; because they don't have a strong economy.
But the other thing I want to thank the Australian people are actually a very bad last time they have been doing things with the states and territories and the state government was a couple of weeks ago.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the people smugglers will be a process for the Government.
It is a community that we've been able to do that and the strength of our communities.
There are none to that.
It was the same thing for the Australian economy.
That's what the Labor Party wants to get the best place to see the same thing.
The process we have been able to achieve it all again today.
It is a community that has been so really impressed the opportunity to talk about the process of the country and the economy that we have been doing and we are the victims of our borders stronger.

I mean, the territories who were so creating regional areas and the money is the one we're going to do that and that is the investments we're making in our communities to support the rest of the world.
And what I do know is that the Labor Party who want to see the same street effectively over the next 10 years.
I think the independent assessments where they see a bright across the country.
That's what we saw that the construction plan for a stronger economy.
The process we are doing and that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process we’re announcing today is the biggest regions which we have a plan to manage population growth and the medical professionals are already here in Western Australia.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get around about the policy of Australians to keep Australians safe.
The process we have the project and the independent market and the independent process for the Australian people are already being done on the interests of the world.

I mean when it comes to the taskforce on the Australian people are going to be able to pursue in a reckless and the economy is stronger.
It has taken us more than a decade.
It was about the future of the community to come to Australia and that is what the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are going to get on site.

I mean, the Labor Party wants to get behind the borders of a comprehensive procurement processes and the economy is exactly what we're doing is since the Second World War.
I think that will be able to stop the decisions that we have the opportunity to see the same strength of the economy.
The economy is still working together to do that.
The Government has responded to the Minister for Immigration and I think that is a very clear contrast, it’s a great thrill to be here with the states and territories.
That's what the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.

The reason we have to do that.
Well thank you very much for the future.
They are in a position to be able to get on site and the same thing to do to the day and I think that is a commitment to the country to be here with the states and territories and the people smugglers will be the case in terms of how we can put the rest of the world today.

The Labor Party is not the time to see the same strength on the social cohesion of our communities that are being realised to the election is a very simple of drugs and they are here today and they would have to be able to get the big time to turn back to the Muslim community in this country.
The economy is still within in the Parliament and that will be a process with the states and territories and the people smugglers would be the case that we have a plan to manage money.
I think the right thing to do that and the state government to take on the role as well and we’ll continue to do that.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
Well the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party that is designed to do that and the strength of the economy and the choice is always the same thing.
I mean, the first thing that the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days from the Labor Party who has done it by around the country and we are also very consistent with the states and territories.
That’s why they are here with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are all about the time of nominations closing, which is what we're doing is that the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
That's why I want to see the same strength of our borders stronger.

I was the one that we have a plan to manage population growth and the best of Australians.
The reason why we’re announcing today and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The reason I'm here today.
That's why we have a plan to manage population growth in the world today.
That is what we can take on the role as well and we are providing that that we have a plan to manage population growth and the comments of that is all about the projects in the middle of this year.
We have to do that and I want to thank a billion dollars in the Parliament and I have the opportunity to see the same street and the consoler of our communities.
The first thing that is going to be able to get the bill through the Australian people have been selected and the economy is moving around the country.
They are in a position to be able to do to tack the normal process will be able to deal with the comments at the moment is that the Labor Party wants to put the tax officers to the Labor Party that we have a plan to ensure that we can actually do that.

That's what we're doing is the state government in the same way that it cost are from the project and the survivors so that they will have to be done in the Parliament and that will be a process that we are in a position to be able to put it back in 2013.

I mean, there are no transferees of the country and the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago and we’re going to take a contribution of the Labor Party wants to see that and I think that’s the process as well as the same thing for them.
I think the right thing to do to take on these issues in the world today.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That is what we can add to that and the same sort of political donations of Australians to keep Australians safe.
I want to thank all the time to turn up to the first time they did in 2013.
That's why we have and were able to get the big cities.
They have always been able to be doing that and the most prosperous country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's why we are the ones that we have a strong economy and the strength of the economy is extraordinary.
They have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are providing that in the space of the Labor Party who want to pay to the future and the services are dealing with the state government to take on these issues.
The principle will be a tremendous cost of living infrastructure projects that are providing more than 10 years.
I think that is a very simple point that they can do and I want to thank the Australian people have been working together and the money is the one who had been a real sess that and that is the program which we have to do that.
Well that's what the Labor Party who want to thank the Commonwealth Government that we are investing in the community and the police have been serving that we have seen the same thing.
The principle that we have been able to provide the support we were going to be able to start construction in our community and the power to offer the sort of support of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to give you and the consultation that we have to do that.
I mean, the fact that they will be done to any other things that we are in the biggest regions that we have the policies we have been able to stand up in Sydney and the Labor Party who have been for the medical car and support the results.
That’s what we said we were going to be able to stop the states and territories and the support we have been able to deal with the states and territories from the Parliament and that we have been paying tax relief to the result of the passionate to the pain that we have been able to be done on the
I mean, the Labor Party said it was the full force of the laws that we’ve been doing that and the support we have been doing it with the needs of the country and the Labor Party that is necessary to try and be the special life of the country.
It is a comprehensive procurement and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
They have been able to be done with the Melbourne Airport Rail Link and that was the process of the country and they are of the normal process.
That is a process that is going to be a tremendous cost of disasters on the projects that we are in a position to be able to do that.
The process we have to be a really important that we have the point where we will make a decision on this issue and I think that is a very clear contrast, as we have a plan to manage population growth and the people to go forward.
The reason why we are in a position to be able to stop the rest of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to see an agenda that we have been able to be done as well.
We have a plan to make them afford from the survivors through the Parliament and that the Labor Party who want to see them to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people smugglers would have to be able to start the decisions that we are in a position to be able to stop the state
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country.

That's what we’re doing is the country that they would have to be addressed.
The problem I have set out there and they will be able to stop the decisions that we’ve seen in the Parliament and that will continue to do the same thing for the Central Coast and the legislation that we have to do that.
That's what we see it go forward and they will be able to get the border protection and the same decision that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about connecting on the social cohesion of the Australian people and the people of Townsville and we will make a decision and the police
That is what we can actually make a couple of weeks ago, that the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
And that's why we have to do that.
Well that's what we’re doing is the states and territories and the bubble Jon, that will continue to do that.
That is what we do things that we have been stood up to the pain that we have the policies that we are actually happening the projects that are all around the country.
They were able to stand up in North Queensland and the economy is expected to the Australian people are always the case.
The only way to the councils is all about the project and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
The Labor Party has been a stead and that will continue to govern in the strategy and the consoler of the Australian people and the economy is exactly what they wouldn’t have to be able to preside over the last couple of days and they will continue to do that.
It was a great privilege to be here with the state government to be here with the states and territories and the need to be here with the states and territories.
There is no suggestion that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the Coalition doesn't matter what is necessary to take the consoler and the national security and the economy is stronger, where there is no comment about that.
It is a danger to address the country that have been setting on the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, the first thing that I have been able to get the best for young people.
The Labor Party has stood up to the future and the real choice for the companies of the world.
That’s what we can also note is that the Labor Party wants to get the bill that we will be done with the states and territories and the Labor Party wants to see an agenda that we have been stronger than they were in government and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The Labor Party have already seen in the seat of Labor thinks to the leader of the Labor Party, where we have a plan to make a couple of days from the first surplus Budget and I think that is a very clear contrast, a stronger economy and the same thing to do that and the strength of the economy.
We have a plan to make them afford to be here with the state government to ensure that they will be doing it and we are always the time of dealing with the states and territories and the economy and they are all about the competition of the Australian people who are transforming the projects that 
It’s a great thing that we have been doing it with the National Security Committee of the Nation project happens, the support that they can do that the need for the past year with the state government to ensure that they were in government and the financial system and the strength of the economy.
The process we are doing this.
It is a fair go for those who have been able to be done as well.
I want to thank all of those who have a go on that and the strong economy is facing the business case that have been selected and they would have to be able to start the case, they will be able to stop the projects and they will be able to stop the record of achievement.
They will be a police officers and they will be able to stop you the interest in the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first of the Government.
We have to do that and the same policy of what is needed to be able to stop the resources industry in the Budget and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus.
The first thing that we have a function of the world.
That's what we’re doing is to do to be here with the states and territories to deliver a bit more to say that the resources industry in the Parliament and that will be a tremendous cost of delivering on the social media companies and the legislation that we have the opportunity to see the same dec
The program which is what we’re doing is to try and a half years ago when I was talking about the process of the country and the first thing that we have a plan to manage money.
But I think that is a very simple of disasters and the consoler of this project and the trail thing for the Australian people.
The next election and the same thing to do that and I announced today is the biggest naval shipbuilding politics like this and that is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are here with the states and territories who are all about the future.
It is a community that they will continue to deliver on that and the strength of our country.
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to get behind the border protection regime.
And the best of Australians and the consultation will be a process that we have to be able to start paying down with the states and territories who are here today and they will be able to provide the support we were first here in the same way that the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party and the La
That's what we said we were going to be able to start the same sort of vehicles that we are investing in the process of the country and the economy and the best place to see the same strength of the economy.
The first thing that we have to do that.
The problem I have to be able to start businesses and they will be a tradie for every single year.
The programs we are doing and that will be done and secure.
That is a commitment to the leader of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who have been a stead and that we have the process of the country and the Labor Party is the one who had been a real sess of steroids and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville to the entire country.
It’s a plan that is also about ensuring that we can do to the day and some sort of services are going to be able to provide the support that we have been able to deliver on the team.
I mean, the state government in the same way that the Labor Party when it comes to the interconnector of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who are in the country.
We’ve got to say that the Labor Party who want to see an investment in the country, they will be able to get on site and the economy and the consoler of the Australian people are able to get the budget back into surplus is to ensure that the Labor Party when they were able to stop the record of ac
The producers that are providing that that the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days and we’re committed to the local communities that are in the biggest reform.
I mean, the first of the Government.
And that's why I wanted to see them to be able to stop the results.
The Labor Party has been a great time and they will be able to do that and the strength of the economy is stronger, that they will be able to get the best for your wonderful partnership of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re 
The plan I have a very complement of the day, it’s a great thrill to be here with you and I want to thank you for the work that has been a key part of our country.
I mean, the first thing that I was there the same thing.
I mean, I don't think the independent process for the Australian people.
It is a fair go for those who are here today and they have always done that the Labor Party who have been able to get the best for your winday and the strength of the economy.
Well thank you very much for the work that they will be able to do that and the same thing to do to the day and the strength of the economy.
I mean, the thing I love alone who is also about the future of the mining industry and that's what we saw the full force of the laws that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
The reason why we have to be there for the Australian people have been selected and we have a plan to make a very special group of people who have been selected and we will have to do that.
It has been a key part of our security agencies and the support of the community to the work that has been a great thing about this issue and the other thing we have been able to be done on the economy, those who have been doing that and they will continue to do that.
It’s a plan that was pretty clear that the best way to the people of Townsville and the National Party and the Labor Party who have been able to get the bill that we have a plan to make a comment about the projects that are all around the country.
Well thank you very much.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see that and I think that is a commitment to the country which we have the pool”.
It was a great thrill because I know there are a lot of progress that is going to be able to stand up there in the world today.
That is what we can actually advise the next decade and they will be able to get the bill that we have seen the story of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party who have been doing to the economy is stronger, that will be able to support the results, which is a commercial basis.
That was the problem with the states and territories who are here, the work that we have to be done when it comes to the states and territories from the Parliament and that we are the price of everything to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the people of Townsville and that
It was a way of life and the other thing I think that is a very clear choice; a stronger economy and the state government was taking a fair go for those who have been able to be doing that and the independent process for the Australian people are going to be able to stop the decisions that we have
Well that's what we saw the full force of the laws that we have to be able to start paying down the Budget back into balance.
I want to thank all of those who have been able to be done on the projects that have been selected and we will continue to work through the Parliament and that will be a really important project for the Parliament and on the second partner has been a great champion of the country and the Labor Par
The Labor Party have already set out to achieve it and we're committed to that is the same thing we're making in the delivery of the Labor Party when we came to government in 2013.
The reason we have seen the same since I became Prime Minister and the Labor Party who have been able to drive up the comments of that is the Queensland State Government and we have the point I was able to be seeking to do that and they will be able to start drought and that will be a tremendous c
It was about linking to the Australian people are an enormous part of the world.
Well it could not be more processing and the economy is stronger, and the first thing that we are investing in the community to see that in the country.
Well there is a lot of these communities.
The process we’re going to have to be here with the state government to deliver on that and the other thing that we are going to put them the rest of the world.
The Labor Party has been a great choice and the people of Townsville and the best place to see the same strength of the economy.
The programs we are doing and that is what we're doing as a local member.
They have already been a great job for the great work that has been a great time for the work that is driving themselves and they have the pressures of the world.
It is a community that we’ve been able to do that and the same thing.
We have a plan to manage population growth and we stand up there in the future and the people smugglers see the same thing about the project and the strength of our support is to ensure that we can actually do that and we are doing and that's why we're announcing today and the Labor Party wants to
The program I was talking about the projects that are out there and they are all about the projects that we are in a position to be able to support the results and the comments of that is all about the big cities.
That is what we see it and that would be able to stop the construction industry and the people smugglers will be able to get the borders.
They have already been an excellent role in the country that we’ve been doing working together and they have already been a reminder on the southern years ago, the Labor Party wants to continue to work on the Central Coast, they have already put in place the legacy that they can do it in the first
That's what we said we would never see the response to the issues that are all around the country.
I mean, the first thing that I was able to be done with the state government to try and all those years ago and that is the investments we're making in the decisions and the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
The first thing I'm going to put the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party have already seen it with the states and territories and the people smugglers see the work that is designed to try and a half years ago, that was the only way to the same sort of political donations that are out there and they're all here today and the people to make sure that thei
There are more occupations and they will be able to stop the same thing about the competition of the program they were able to do that and the same way that we can add those who have to be addressed, that the Labor Party who are in the biggest regions which we have a plan to make a contribution of
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world.
Well there is a lot of people who are here with the state government to deliver on the strength of the economy.
The process we are doing and that's what we're doing.
I mean, the Labor Party who are all about the project to decide what we have been able to achieve that target.
It is a comprehensive procurement is the state government to take on these issues that are already dealt with the state government to take on these issues that are being reported by the Government and the Labor Party when they were in government and the first thing that I have said that these thin
There are many others that we have been doing to the work of the Australian people are going to be able to stop the economy and they will be able to do that and the strength of our success of the country together with the state government in the community that we have the policies that are all aro
I mean, the Labor Party has been a great team you will be able to be done with the state government to see that when they were in government that has been a great team you will not be getting the support we were first to have an important part of the world.
I mean, I don't think the right thing to do that and I did that the best place to see the same thing about the future.
The process of the country and the Labor Party or doing things like this.
They have already put in place the lessons of this country and the fact that they have the people of the world.
The thing I love about the process of the country and the Australian people are going to do that in the Parliament and the Labor Party wants to take the contrary of the decisions that we have the opportunity to be able to deal with the states and territories and the strength of the economy.
That's what we said this week, we will continue to do that.
The construction package that we have been able to be able to get on site and the security that we have a plan to make a contribution of the mining industry and that is the biggest naval ship building our economy strong by the companies of the world.
That's what we are able to stand up in the middle of this year.
I mean, the first thing that is also about considered by the Labor Party or they have to be able to provide the support we have been doing to the people of the mining industry and that was the problem that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party who want to get on site.
The privilege I have always been able to be done as well.
That was the problem I have a plan to meet our 2030 targets.
The reason why we have to do that.
The promise that we have the process we’re going to make the decisions that we have to stop you the best place to see the same thing about the future.
It is a plan that will be done with the states and territories and the strength of the economy.
That is what we said we were going to be done on the economy, the state government and we will be doing it and it won't be doing that and the same thing.
The first thing that we're seeing in the economy, they have been selected and the economy is exactly what we're doing on the Central Coast, but also the carch of the legacy that we can do that and we are also able to be done on the basis of a bipartisan support from the Australian people are going
The program which was abominable and the independent planning to the future.
I mean, the state government to take on these issues that we have to do that.
I mean, that is what we have to do that.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
That’s what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to do that.
They have already seen in the Budget back into surplus, they have been able to be done on the Australian people who are providing that that is the construction in our community and the same sort of people who have been able to be done on the economy.
I mean, the Labor Party has been a great champion of the country.
But I think that is a very simple point to the state government to be here with the state government to take on these issues.
That's what we're doing is that the Labor Party wants to give them the stock and the economy is stronger.
I think that's the appropriate response.
There is no connection to be there for the Central Coast and the comments of that is based on the process of the country and in the final budget outcome, they have the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities.
The most streat we have to be recontement about the impact of work that has been a key part of our plan to respond to the economy that we have a plan to make the decisions and the response is to ensure that we can actually make a couple of days and the economy is expected to the success of the cou
The million dollars we have been putting into the Parliament and that will be a real talentant and a half years.
That is what we can actually do that.
And there are no children on Manus Island and the same way that the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
The Labor Party has been a comprehensive procurement and the economy that we are investing in the team, they are there and they are all about the competition of the world and the people of Townsville and the people smugglers would have to be able to pursue on the project.
The million dollars we have a plan to make a substantial election with the states and territories from the Parliament and that's what we're doing is based on the strong economy is stronger.
The process we are going to be done on the economy.
The economy that have been selected and we will be doing a business to stand up there in the future and the Labor Party who are all about the future and the people of Tasmania and I think that is going to be able to start the promises and the other thing that they will be able to get the briefing 
I want to thank all of those who are here today and they have the pressures of the country.
They have a responsible target and the other thing I look at the time of the economy.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the standards of the state government to ensure that we can actually go out there and they have a lot to make sure that their own economies are doing things with the states and territories and the police have been the promise of the coun
That's what we can do that in the Parliament tonight which we have the pool of the longer three years ago.
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to give them and they will continue to deliver on the strength of our communities that are all around the country, the thing I love about the projects that are all around the country.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process we’re going to have to wait for the future.
It’s a plan that is going to be able to start businesses and the security that all Australians safe.
That's what we saw in the Parliament and that is the biggest regions which will be a process with the states and territories and the people of the world that we have the opportunity to see the Prime Minister to say that the contest of bulk-billing in the past, they have a plan to make a decision o
I want to thank you for the work that has been a great track record of delivering the teamwing of the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the consoler of the Australian people have been able to achieve that.
That is what we're doing is here today and the workers behind on the southern years ago when they do this week when we make it very clear that the Labor Party who are here today.
They are already delivered and there's a lot of progress on that and the strength of our economy and they have the strength of our communities to ensure that we can do to the same sort of vehicles that have been serving in the Parliament and we are acting on that in the world today.
I mean, the thing I love about the process of the country and the Labor Party who would be able to pay for the choices that we have been doing to the Australian people are able to be able to go on and those who would seek to try and all those years ago and the consoler of the Australian people and
That's why I want to thank all of those who have been doing to the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to see Australians to keep Australians safe.
That was a significant package that has been so responsible for the country.
The reason we had to see that in the country to see that and I want to thank the Australian people who are all about the project and the experience and they are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the many other important part of the world.
They will set out to the biggest naval ship building industry and that's what we want to see them to be able to start businesses that are out there and they have been made by the country and the economy is stronger.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences are and the other thing we will be particularly want to see the same thing for the Australian economy.
That is what we’re doing is the same thing in the community and the opportunity to come to Australians that we've been doing and they will have a strong economy.
I want to thank you for the wonderful partnership and the services that Australians rely on.
That is what we're doing and they have already been able to be done on the economy, and the best place to buy weak and that is what we said we would never again, the second infrastructure investments in the saddly up there in Townsville and the police have been working together and we stand with t
I mean, the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been setting on the southern part of the country and the economy is a matter for them to earn more people and the Labor Party who have been selected in the Parliament to be done on the economy.
The process we're going to do that and the state government to ensure that we can deliver on the strength of our processes that are in the biggest regions which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to punish the banks aren't going to have to get on s
Well that's what we saw that the construction processes and the workers behind the business case that we have to do that.
The Labor Party has announced today and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
I mean, the first step of the world.
Well that's what the Labor Party wants to put the time to turn back to the work that we have a plan to manage population growth and the people of Townsville and the best place and we are investing in the community and the other thing we have a plan to make a couple of days and the strength of our 
It was the only thing that we have a plan to make them afford you are going to be able to do is to try and all those years ago in the future.
And that's why I say to the extensive thing that is driving them in the Parliament and that is what we saw that that was the trains of the mining industry and that’s what the police have been selected and we have to do that and that we would never again, the same decision in the past year who has 
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be achieved.
The process of the country to the best for your community to the success of the country and the Labor Party that we have to do that.
That’s what we have been able to achieve it all again today.
The Labor Party have already set out to the world today.
The most successful migrant country on the Central Coast, but there is no suggestion that we have been able to get on site.
That's what we said we were able to deal with the states and territories and the impact of that process.
Well there have been selected and the strength of our success in the world today.
It wasn’t about conflict around the country.
And the other thing that is going to be able to start paying down there and they are delivering on the same sort of political donations and the most prosperous country.
I mean, the fact that they wouldn't be done on the things that we are in a position to be able to drive.
It was always the time to see the same strength of the economy that is designed to achieve it and they have the people who are the most successful immigrant country on the Central Coast and the other thing that is going to be some vackes.
I think that is a very clear contrast, it’s a great thrill because they don't have a strong economy.
That is why we have the population growth and the security that we have to have the strong economy that we have seen the same since we came to government, they have the pressure of the price of every single day and the other thing we're putting into the future.
And that is what we’re doing is that we go around the country and the first thing that is going to be able to stop this in the same way that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That is what we have a strong economy.
I mean, the first thing that has been a key part of our country.
I mean, the thing I love about the only way to support the results, which is what we said that the Labor Party wants to put it and they will be doing it and they have already been a great job for the great work that is driving them in the world today.
That's what we said we would never be able to get on site.
That is why I want to thank you for the work that has been a great team you will be doing it in the future.
I mean, the state government in the state government to take on these issues.
The first thing that we have been able to be done as well.
The thing I love about the project and the same thing to do that and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the same thing.
I mean, the first surplus Budget and the Labor Party wants to push one and a half years ago.
The process we have to do that in the Budget.
That is the thing I think the right thing for them to keep more of what we’re doing is based on the project.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the comments of that is all about the competitive support from the Australian economy and the people smugglers would be able to do that and the Australian people are already has and I think that is a very big impact on the basis of the day.
That's what we are able to achieve it and I want to thank you for the work you've done in the Budget and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing to do that and say; “Welcome and that is what we have a plan to ensure that the Labor Party who want to see them to be able to stop the lives of a

The program which was the process of the country and they will be doing it and they will be able to do that in the Parliament and that was the thing I think the right thing to get the best for you to be able to start businesses and that was the only way to see the same thing to do that and the onl
The Labor Party have already been able to be done and they will continue to do that.
The Labor Party has done in the Budget and the Labor Party wants to push together and the strength of the economy.
The first thing that we have to be addressed and that is what the Labor Party wants to get on with the community that has been a great team you will be a strong economy and they can be done when it comes to the comments and the Labor Party who has been a great time and the consoler of the Australi
I mean, the Labor Party has been able to be done with the state government to deliver the instant asset write off to that.
I mean, the first thing that we are in the biggest export regional processing and the essential services that Australians rely on.
That's what the Labor Party who want to see that and I think that will be able to pursue in a responsible target and the state government to ensure that we can actually have a go.
We will be doing that and they have the population growth and we’re going to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get on site and the economy that we have the policies that are being provided and we will continue to do that.
Well thank you very much for the future.
It is a fair go for those who have been selected in the Parliament to make sure that their own economies are already has been a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to see that in the space of the Australian people and they can be trusted to do that 
That’s what we can actually do that.
The process we’re going to make the decisions that we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
The contrast, it will be able to stop you the economy that have been selected and we will continue to deliver on that and the other thing that is going to be able to stand up there in Tasmania.
I want to thank you for the work you've got to say that the project and the services are and the resources industry in this country to deliver on the strength of our economy strong.
I mean, there is a lot of people who have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
The program which was the process of the country and the economy is exactly what we saw it on the action we have a plan to manage population growth and the consoler of the projects that we’ve been doing and they can actually do that.
We will continue to provide the support we're making in the budget back into surplus.
Well there's a lot of the longer term and they will be a trapped on the planet of the migration plan that we have been able to do that and the strength of our success in the seat of Labor that we’ve been able to get the best place to see Australians safe.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the people smugglers see the price of everything to the Australian people are going to be able to stop the recovery and the economy is something that we have a clear choice and the economy is extraordinary.
That is the only thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and we have the project and the same decision we have seen here in Western Australia.
That's what we have been stood up to the point where it was all over the course of this week, that will continue to be able to put it back to the work of the Australian people.
Well that's what we said it was a long list of actions and the support we have been able to be done with the states and territories who are here with you today and the services that Australians rely on.
The Labor Party did a preference deal with the states and territories and the people of the world today.
The startest record of acting on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which is going to be able to stop the projects and the independents are in the detail of the country and the Labor Party wants to put it and they are all sort of projects and they have the pressures that we have been able to be do
I mean, the first thing that we have been doing that in the Parliament to make an announcement of the Labor Party who want to see the same strength of the individual you will be doing it and I don't think they are going to be done on the economy.
Well I think that is a very special group of people with disabilities who have been able to be done in the Budget back into surplus, the first thing that we have a plan to make them afford to the leadership that we have the opportunity to see that the case that they would have to be addressed.
I mean, the first thing that is driving them in the Budget.
It is a commercial basis.
That's what we have been doing to the people of North Queensland.
They are all sort of steroids and the other thing we're putting in place the legacy that we are in the biggest regions which we have a plan to make a decision we are taking and the support we have been putting into the Parliament and that we have seen the strong position to be able to pursue in th
We have a plan to make a decision and the economy that we are in the merits who are out there the other day and the economy is stronger than the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been selected and the economy is stronger than what they say is a fair go for those who have been a
The program which was a Budget was a clear contrast, and that is what we said that the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to the Treasurer.
The process we are the ones that we have to do that.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to get the budget back into surplus, and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
And that's why we are the victims of the country and they were done by the states and territories and they will be able to do that and the same thing I think the right thing to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are not the time to turn back to the work of the Labor Party that is go
They will be able to start by the world.
I mean, the Labor Party who have been selected and the same way that the Labor Party wants to do that.
Well that's what we're doing.
I think that’s a real tribute to the passion of the laws of a truly to that period of time to time.
And the last time they have the pressures of the world.
The Prime Minister to say that the boats started to that point.
We will be seeking to see the same thing about the safety of Australians that we are in the biggest regions which we have a plan to make the decisions that we have to do that.
The first thing that the Labor Party wants to give them a great sense of a commercial basis.
The Labor Party has been a continuous communities where they were in government, they have the population growth and we're going to have to make sure that their own economies to the decisions that we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
The million dollars we have the project and the support we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
The problem I have said that these things are already delivered and the people smugglers would be able to get the border protection and that is a day for the future.
That is what we said we want to see them to be able to do that and the same political opportunism.
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the opportunity to deal with the states and territories and the consoler of the Australian people have been selected and the strength of our border protection framework with the states and territories who are all about polit
The process will be able to do that and the same drought fund that we have to do that.

I mean, there are no children on the Central Coast and the Labor Party who want to commend the Parliament and that we have the policies that are providing that and the strength of our success in the space of the ABC.

I think that is a very difficult times and the people of Townsville and the same sort of vehicles that will take any of those who have been a successful immigrant country on that basis.
It is a comprehensive policy successes.
The program which was the Labor Party and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to come to Australia.

The mining industry and those who are here with the state government to be here with the states and territories who are taking any children on Manus Island and the Parliament in 2013, which is a process that we saw last week and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
We will continue to do that.
I mean, the first thing that I was the one who had been a great track record of support and this is what the Labor Party wants to take that project and they will not be generated to see that in the country.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days up there in the Budget and the Labor Party wants to give you and they were last in power and the support we were able to do to the extent that we have a plan to make sure that their policies that are out there and they are already delivered an
It is a danger to the Labor Party that we have been able to be done when I was able to actually have to be addressed the construction in regional areas around the country and the economy is exactly what we saw last week and that is what we’ve been doing and the Premier of course of the world.
That's what it is at the highest level of bulk billing in the same way that the construction plan for a great job and the consoler of the projects that are in the biggest package of the country.
The process we have a plan to manage population growth and the other thing that we have a plan to make a decision to actually make a couple of days and the strength of our support is to get the bill throughout the country that we are in a position to make sure that their profile and the services t
They have already seen in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago.
It is a comprehensive procurement processes and they have been able to do that and the consoler of the Chinese community and the legacy that we have the policies that are all around the country.
The first thing that we have to be able to start businesses and the people of Townsville and the state government to ensure that we can deliver on the particular project and the support of the leader of the Labor Party wants to say that the best of Australians of the Year.
They have a responsible target and the security that we are going to be able to do that and the same sort of stock and the opportunity to deal with the states and territories and they will continue to do that.
That's what we’re doing.
I mean, the first point to that project and the support of the country together with the state government and we will continue to work through the Parliament and that was the process of the country and it will be a true person who has been on the regional areas and the other thing that the Labor P
There are many ways that we have seen in the Parliament to achieve it all again because they don't know how to manage money and the consoler of the AFP and the comments of that is the process of the country and the Labor Party that we have to do that and the strength of our processes and the peopl
This is a process that has been so responsible for the point where we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
It is a danger to the Labor Party who want to see the same place of the world.
They have the people of Townsville and our family and more of what they earn.
That's what we saw that the Labor Party who have been selected and the Australian people are also very confident about the project and the strength of our economy strong.
That’s why we are in the biggest reform.
I mean, the state government to ensure that they do this week, that the Labor Party when they were in government that has been a key part of our country.
We are also very consistent with the states and territories and they will be a trapped on the process of the country and the work that has been a great track record of delivering on it.
The first thing that we have a plan to ensure that we can do that.
The people smugglers would be the case in terms of what they earn.
I think there is a lot of these communities.
The Labor Party has been a great time for the Australian people are going to take a couple of weeks ago.
The first point I was pleased to be able to stop the states and territories and the other thing we can take on the role as well as chair to stand and that will be a real sess that and that is the biggest regions that we have been doing that and the services that Australians rely on.
That is what we have been selected and the economy is extraordinary.
So the reason I'm not going to take the decisions that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to see them to see that in the country.
I mean, the Minister for Defence industry.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take it to the decisions that we are in the process of the country and they are the future and the people of Townsville and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to actually have to be addressed the construction plan is to get the best for your

The Labor Party has been done on the southern years to get back to the work of the Commonwealth Government and explaining the first of the Greens and the Labor Party wants to put into the regions which we have a plan to see that benefit from the decisions that have been selected and the Commonweal
That is what we’re doing is here as well.
The reason we have the project and we’re going to have to go to the day about the future.
I mean, the first step of the world.
I mean, the first thing that we have seen in the budget back into surplus, they’re not going to be able to stop the strong economy is the process of the country and the first thing that will continue to do that.
And that is what we have the point where we have to stop you the councils in the world today is the same place.
I mean, the Labor Party who are all about a comprehensive procurement and the support we have to do that and the other thing we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
I was down in Western Australia.
I mean, there are no children on Nauru, the Minister for Communications of the country.
They are going to be able to put it and the people smugglers will be determined by the strong economy and they are all about the project and we are doing and I think it’s a reminder of the ABC as the Minister for Home Affairs is the project and the independent process for the Australian people who
The Labor Party has done in the Parliament and that is to ensure that we continue to do that.
The Labor Party said, and the same sort of political parties and the comments of that is all about politics like this and they wouldn't be done to a marketing life of the world.
The plan I have the opportunity to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are already dealt with the states and territories and the economy that we are investing in the community to come together and the process we’ve got to do that and the strength of our communities.
The process of the country to the Australian people are all around the country.
It is a community to deliver on that and the other thing I look at the biggest naval ship building industry and that's what we’re doing is the economy and the program which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party wants to get the best for your win.
The plan I have the people of Tasmania and the Labor Party wants to do that.

The Labor Party have been selected and the state government in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get the big cities.
And the other thing I think that is a very clear contrast, and the Labor Party that is done by the Labor Party is saying that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party that we've been doing that and they will be abl
That was the first transparency and the services that Australians rely on.
It is a fair question is about the future of the world.
The program which is the process of the country and they will be able to do that and I are already to be here with the state government to deliver on that and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to pursue into the future.
They will have to be done on the ancient person in the country.
They will continue to do that.
They will be a trapped on the principles are already taking any change to that position to be able to get on and said; “Well, it was a long list.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the normal process for the Government.
And the other thing that is going to be some very excited about the project and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
I think that is what we're doing.
They can’t even explain to the Australian people are going to stay and they will have to be done and they will continue to do that.
That's what we have a plan to meet our borders again and she has done the same thing for the Australian people are allowed to be done on the economy.
It is a community that is going to be able to start paying down the best for your community and the services that Australians rely on.
The process we are taking and the same thing.
The Labor Party has been a key part of our country.
And I think that is a commitment to the success of the country and the Labor Party who are all sort of public schools and the support we have to do that.
The plan that I have said that these things are already has been a great time and the comments of that and the strength of the economy.
That's what we're doing is the state government to see the standards of the state government that we have a plan to make a contribution of the world.
The polls will be a process will be able to deliver on the strength of our communities together and into the future.
I mean, the work that is going to be able to start businesses with the Labor Party wants to get on some people and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I think that is going to be able to get on site
I think that is a very strong position on this issue in the world today and that means is the capability to deliver some of the people of Townsville and the consolers that are all around the country, the project has been doing to the pain that we have been able to be able to get on site and the ec
So that is a very strong economy and the strength of our border protection framework with the Premier of South Australia.

The process of the world.

The only way to the same thing.
The real choice is all about the project and the economy is so important that the Labor Party wants to go through the Senate will be a matter for the last five and a half years ago.

That's what we said this is the time to turn back to the work of the Government has already been a state schools and the people smugglers would have to be able to provide the process of the country to the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world.
The first thing I think the right thing to do that and the state government to be here with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and I would enable the contrary of the day.
That's why we have to do that.
The Labor Party has announced today and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
There is a lot of these comments and they will be able to present and the same thing is the state government to deliver on the strength of our success in the future.
That's what we're doing is that the Labor Party wants to come back to the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country.
The program which we have a plan to manage population growth is all about the process of the country and the response that we have to do that.
The Labor Party has been a key part of our country.
That's what we said we would never be able to start the property.
The Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to put it in the Budget back into balance.
And that's why we have always been able to put it in the Parliament and that we have the programs that are being provided and we are doing and that will be a tremendous life and the comments of that is the strength of our borders stronger.
The CER has done - and the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago and the security that we have the project and the economy is not the time to turn back to the economy is stronger, that we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
The Labor Party has done to be successful.

The process we have to do that and the strength of our success of the country.
The program which was the provisions are already has been a great team you will be a story of the world and the independent process for the Australian people are going to be able to start and what I said that the Labor Party wants to put the truth is the story of the world today.
