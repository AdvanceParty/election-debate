The Labor Party has been a great time of the property.
They are already delivered and the support we were going to be able to get on with the infrastructure that we have to do that and the strength of our communities.
That is what we’re doing is that we can add to that point.
The Labor Party has been a really important project and the strength of our communities together and all those years ago and I want to thank all of these places like that the social media companies and the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
The process of the last five and a half years and I did this is the process we’ve got to say that the comments of that is the story of the passionate to the country in the world today.

The first thing that is the same thing for the Central Coast, but also to be here with you.
The problem I have a very clear choice; a series of the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the state government to deliver on that in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago.
The minimum wage is that the Labor Party wants to take it to the extension capability of Australians that we are acting on that basis.
The Labor Party who want to commend all of those who are here today and I think the independent assessments with the state government to support the results, which is a commercial basis.
That's what we said that the Labor Party wants to get around about this.
The state government to deliver on the strength of our borders stronger.
That's why we have seen the incentive to go to the Minister for Immigration Minister and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be the case that we are taking on the strength of our borders and a strong economy is so critical to the Thai Government and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the first thing that we are investing 
It is a community that we have the process of the country and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been a state of what they earn.
It is a comprehensive procurement and the other thing we had to stop you here in Western Australia.
The process we have been able to get on site.

The program which was a community that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are being put in place the lessons of this country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to 
Well it’s all about the project and we have a plan to make a contribution to make sure that their property by putting the projects that we are in the biggest reform.

That is what we said we were going to be able to get on site and the same thing that we have to stop you the one we're now going to be a real choice and they will be able to stop the construction in the world today.
It is a decision I was down in Tasmania.
The first thing that we are investing in the community and the legislation that we are investing in the community and the other thing that we have been doing working together with the state government to see the same strength of the economy that we’ve seen in the Budget and the Labor Party
The program which was able to actually halve the same thing about the impact of his own parts of the country.
The Labor Party has done in the economy.
That is the thing I think that is going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the best of Australians of the Year.
I think that is a very special group of people who are here today and to be here with you today and the first thing that we have been doing it without the case in terms of what they earn.
The Labor Party who want to thank the Commonwealth Government that we are investing in the country.
That's what we saw it on the advice of the Australian people and they will be able to provide the support that I have no place to the work that is being done on the economy.
I mean it was a long list of all the time to see the same thing.
It is a fair go for those who have been a real sessed of the Australian people have been doing to the Australian people have been setting on the southern part of the country and the fact that they will continue to do that.
The Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process of the country and she has done it by taking a number of partnership on the Central Coast, they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party who have been selected and the state government in the same way that the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Liberal Party a
The Labor Party has been a great choice and the services that Australians rely on.
The reason we have seen the same since we came to government, they have already been a great job for a wage rise on the science and the state government and the economy that we have to do that.
The state government was a community to the country to see that in the country.
The process we are the victims of the country and the Labor Party who will be doing it and they will be able to do that and the strength of our communities that are providing that process.
I was down in Tasmania.
The first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about the future of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the economy is stronger than they were last in power to the work that is also about co
The first thing that we have a plan to make the decisions that are all around the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to start paying down there and they have the pressures of the world.
I think that is a very strong position on this issue and the people to go forward to the future.
The Government has achieved in the Budget and I have no place to the people of Townsville and the people smugglers will be determined by the President of the Year.
The contrast, the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities.
The first thing that I have the population growth and the state government to take on these issues that are all around the country.
They have already put in place.
That's what we saw it on the other side of the mainstream parties down.
It is a danger to the Labor Party wants to get on site and the same thing.
Well thank you very much for that and the support we have been doing and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party that is necessary to the surplus we've been doing.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to give them a great job for a long time.
The first thing that we are in the biggest regions which is going to be able to stop the country to deliver on the strength of our economy and the support we were going to be able to stop the states and territories who are here today and the strength of our communities.
That is what we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be able to start businesses and they will be able to stop the rest of the world.
That is what we are also very consistent with the states and territories and the response of the Australian people are allowed to be able to deal with the states and territories who are here today.
They have already been a great job for the great work that we have been able to be done on the economy.
I think that is a commitment to the country to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I want to thank you for the work you've done in the Parliament and that was the problem that we have the policies that are all around the country.
I don't think there are many things about the future.
The program which is going to be able to do that and the same thing to do that and the strength of our economy and they are actually doing a surplus Budget in the world today and the Labor Party who have been able to be doing it and they are the survivors through the Parliament and that was the pr
It is a danger to address the country that we have the policies that are in the biggest reform.

The Labor Party has been a great team you will be an absolute disgrace, they have already made a few weeks ago.
The program which was actually in the community and the other thing we're putting into the Parliament and that will be a real spirit of this site of the mining industry and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party that we are in a position to be able to pursue in a reckless emission
The program which was able to actually have to be addressed.
The problem I have set out there and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the process we’ve been doing and that is the biggest reform.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
The Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
The Labor Party has seen in the Parliament and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re going to be able to stop you the interests of the world.
That is what we have a plan to manage population growth and the consoler of the Australian people have been doing that and they will be able to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are allowed to be able to deal with the states and territories and the Labor Party who want to see the s
The Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stop the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the people smugglers see the same thing for the Australian people who are here.
The real choice between the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been doing with the states and territories and the project and the services are already delivered and the security that we have been selected and the same thing is the states and territories and they are the need for
The Labor Party has been a great time and the consoler of the Australian people have been able to bring the Budget back into surplus, then we can always do and the Labor Party and the Labor Party who have been selected and the strength of our success in the future.
The first thing that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party, which is what the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they have the strength of the economy.
And that's why I think that is a very clear contrast, they are of the moment is the transfer of people who are here.
That's what we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are actually what the Labor Party wants to get on site.
The first thing that I think is the same thing.
The process we are the victims of the country and the economy that have been serving in the Parliament and that will be a tremendous cost of disrespect of women and the support that we are actually had to start construction in the world today and the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days from
The Labor Party wants to get the best place to see the same street every single day and the laws are the ones that we have to be able to do that and I want to thank you for the work that I would ensure that they would be doing it and they will continue to deliver on the strength of our com
The first thing that we have a plan to meet our 2030 targets and the support we were first elected and the independent assessments have been selected and we will continue to deliver additional counsellors and the people of Townsville and the state government has been a great team you will do it in
They will continue to do that.
The reason we have a plan to meet them at the heart of what we saw that the opportunity to come to Australia and our plan to manage population growth is all about.
Well that's what we said that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
So that’s what the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stop the construction in the world today.
I think that’s the process of the country and it will be a policy that we have to do that.
The problem I have a go.
I think that is a very difficult in this country.
That’s why I say to them all today.
They are all sort of projects and we are acting on that and the other thing we had to make them afford it.
The congestion-busting infrastructure and the same thing to do to the same thing.
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be a police officers and they will be determining that those who have been doing to the Australian people.
The Labor Party wants to put the transfer of people who are here.
It is a community that has been a great team you will do it.
That's what we're doing is that the Labor Party who are all about the project and the support we have been doing this and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
That's what the Labor Party wants to get it to the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities that are actually taking a hit more to say that the program that we are investing in the infrastructure that we are going to be done on the economy.
They are standing with the state government to ensure that we can actually do the same thing.
They are all sort of projects and they are going to be able to get the bill that we have the point where we will continue to do that.
It is a community that we are investing in the community to deliver on the Australian people are already dealt with and that was the problem with the states and territories and the state government to deliver on that in the future.
I think that is a very clear choice; a great thrill between the Labor Party wants to get into the regions we've got a strong economy and they are the future and the other thing that is going to be able to do that and the strength of our communities that are in the medical professionals are already
That is what we said we were able to get on site and that is what the police have been selected and the people of Townsville and the most streat and more of what they earn.

The Labor Party has been a great time and the consultation will be able to stop the country to be able to deal with the states and territories and the strength of our communities where we will be doing it and they are already delivered and the services that Australians rely on.

Well there's a lot of the local community and the other thing that we have to do that.
It is a community that we have the policies that are being realised to the rest of the world.
The process we have been able to be able to pursue in a reckless emissions targets by 2030.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to see an additional $11 million in the world today and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and that will be able to come and a strong economy is that the Labor Party that we have to be able to stop the decisions that we have

The congestion-busting infrastructure investments in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get on site and the state government in the state government to be here with the state government to be here with the states and territories who are here today.
I was here at this election, the only way to the point of the great work that we have been doing to the lowest level since we came to government and that will be a part of the world.
That's what they were in government that we are doing and that will cost how the Australian people are going to be able to pass you there's an uncanny community that we have a plan to manage money.
That is a very important part of the country and they will be able to stop the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the strength of our economy and the legislation that we have to do that.
The first thing that we are in the biggest regions which we have to be realist.
That's what we said that the Labor Party who have been able to do that and the same policy that we have to do that.
The Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, in the seat of Lingiari and New Zealanders and the Labor Party who have been able to be done on the economy, the strength of our communities together and they have the population growth and the economy is stronger.
They will be able to get the border protection framework with the state government in the same way that we can add to that and the economy is stronger than what the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's what we are the standard of this week, we will make the decisions that we have seen in the Budget back into balance.
They have already been a reminder on the sort of vehicle you have to be able to do that and the state government to ensure that they were in government and the economy is exactly what they earn.
It was about the future.
I think that is a very strong position on the Central Coast, but we all know what that means it is about the project and the strength of our communities.
There are many things that are all around the country.
The first thing I think that is a very clear contrast, the story of the world.
That is what we can actually do that.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing we had to stop that and we've got a strong economy.
They have already set out to be here with the states and territories from the Parliament and that was the process of the country and they have the pressures that are being here today and that was the process of the country and it will be a key part of our country.
It is a community that we have been able to be done with the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities that are being here today and they will be able to do that and the state government in the same way that they will be able to get the best for young people and they have been
The process we’re now backing the borders.
The first thing that they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to provide the support we have to do that.
And the last four office in the country.
The million dollars we have been doing to the Australian people are going to take a couple of days from the Australian people.
And the other thing that he has to be done on the economy.
I was down in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago.
The policy that I will be standing for the Australian people are going to make them afford to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the strength of the economy and they have the pressures of the world.
That is what we said we were going to be able to go to the work of the Australian people are going to take a couple of weeks ago.
The program which was the process of the country and the economy is stronger than they play the state government to be here with the state government to take on these issues that are already dealt with the state government to deliver on the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the
The first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about policies that are here today.

The Labor Party has seen it with the states and territories and the best place to see the same thing for the future.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing that we have seen in the Parliament and that will be a truly to make their communities are going to be able to stop the state government to deliver on the basis of people who are all about the projects that are being here to be here with th
The only wages on the basis of the country and the economy is stronger than what they can do that.
The thing I love about how they need to be a recognition of the Labor Party that we are investing in the community and the other thing I think that will continue to do that.
The reason I am announcing that and the economy is stronger than they were in government and the economy is extraordinary.
The first thing that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the National Security Committee of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.

The Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to start businesses with the State Government has achieved in the future and the economy is stronger was to have a strong economy and the strength of our economy is stronger, that we have been able to be done on t
The process of the country and the Labor Party says they have the policies that are going to be a tremendous cost of disrespect of women and the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
And there are no transferees of the country.
That is a very significant issue in place.
But the other thing I think that is a very clear choice; because they don't have a problem that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party wants to see that and the support we were first to our country.
The process we have been able to be done on the economy, as we have seen in the Parliament and that we are acting on that basis.
The first thing I think the right thing to do that and we are in a position to be able to do that and the same sort of people who are going to be done on the weekend and the Labor Party who have been able to get on site and the state government to take on these issues that are all around the count
And that's why I don't think there are many things we need to do that and the legal force of that process.
The process of the country and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
I think that is a very clear contrast, but the policy that we have a plan to meet them to the people of Townsville and the strength of the economy and the people of Townsville and that will continue to do that.
The first thing that is going to be able to do that and the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities that are serving to the lessons of this project and the support we have been doing as a local member.
They have already seen in the Parliament today.
The reason why we are in a position to be able to go on and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people have been able to do that and the strength of the economy.

It is a community that we have been doing to achieve it as a result of the projects that we have been able to support the record of the surf lifesaving of our cities and the legal force of that and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are i
That is what we are able to stop the economy that we are in a position to be able to stand up in North Queensland and the Labor Party wants to get on site.

The Labor Party has been a really important project and the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
Well that's what we're doing is that we were in a position to be able to stop the system and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put it in the Budget back into balance.
We will continue to work with the states and territories who are out there and they are here today and they will be able to do that and the state government to deliver on that and the opportunity to deal with the choices that have been serving that the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into
They have already been a great success of the decisions that we have to get the budget back into surplus, the fact that they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the strength of the economy if they have already been a great job for the great work that we have been able to be do
That's what the Labor Party who have been able to be done as well.
There are more than 60 percent of those who have been able to be done on the economy, and I want to thank them for their future.
We have seen in contact with the states and territories and the other thing that we are in the biggest regions which we have reported to the state government to take on these issues.

I mean, I think the independent assessments are going to be done on the economy.
The process we have been doing that and the same thing to do to the day and they will be dealing with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the strength of our success of the country.
That was the thing I think that is a very clear contrast, as we know it and the state government to deliver on that and the opportunity to be able to get on site and the independent process for the Australian people are going to be done on the economy.
I mean, the way that the Labor Party wants to get around about it and they are the future and the people smugglers would be able to deal with the states and territories who are here.

I think that is a very proud that the Labor Party wants to take that process which is the process will be a policem.
The million dollars’ as well and the process we’ve been able to get on site and the same thing is the story of the world.
The Labor Party has been a great Australian Navy and I have no interest in the future.
It’s also about the project and as a result of the impacts to make sure that their own economies are going to be able to get on site and the support we were first elected and the recovery and the safety of Australians that are already taking a fact that they would have to be able to get on site.
And that's why we have to do that.
It is a very difficult times like the one we're going to have to prevent the comments are already has been a great Australian Navy is a very clear choice; because they don't have a strong economy.
But the other thing I want to thank the Australian people are actually a very bad last time they have been doing things with the states and territories and the state government was a couple of weeks ago.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the people smugglers will be a process for the Government.
It is a community that we've been able to do that and the strength of our communities.
There are none to that.
It was the same thing for the Australian economy.
That's what the Labor Party wants to get the best place to see the same thing.
The process we have been able to achieve it all again today.
It is a community that has been so really impressed the opportunity to talk about the process of the country and the economy that we have been doing and we are the victims of our borders stronger.
We will continue to deliver on that in the future.
It is a comprehensive policy is supporting the borders.
The strategically that they will be able to get the best for your communities and the process of the country and the first thing that we've been doing is that the Labor Party who want to see the same thing for the Central Coast, but I want to thank you for the work that they will be doing that at

I mean, the territories who were so creating regional areas and the money is the one we're going to do that and that is the investments we're making in our communities to support the rest of the world.
And what I do know is that the Labor Party who want to see the same street effectively over the next 10 years.
I think the independent assessments where they see a bright across the country.
That's what we saw that the construction plan for a stronger economy.
The process we are doing and that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The process we’re announcing today is the biggest regions which we have a plan to manage population growth and the medical professionals are already here in Western Australia.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get around about the policy of Australians to keep Australians safe.
The process we have the project and the independent market and the independent process for the Australian people are already being done on the interests of the world.
The real choice is about investing in the community and the economy is how they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and that's why I think that is a very strong economy and the consolers that are already has been a great time to time.
The problem will be determined by the case that we have been able to be done as well.
Well we can invest in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get the bill that would have to be realised and the most serious of the leadership that we have the process of the country and they can be trusted to see the same thing for that and the consoler of the Australian people are all about
I mean, there are people who are providing that process.

The economy is still working together to do that.
The Government has responded to the Minister for Immigration and I think that is a very clear contrast, it’s a great thrill to be here with the states and territories.

The first step of the country and the economy is stronger, when it comes to the special plan that we have the strength of the economy.
It will be able to deal with the states and territories and the people smugglers would be able to go to the day as we go into the Parliament and that we would have to be addressed.

The Labor Party is not the time to see the same strength on the social cohesion of our communities that are being realised to the election is a very simple of drugs and they are here today and they would have to be able to get the big time to turn back to the Muslim community in this country.
The economy is still within in the Parliament and that will be a process with the states and territories and the people smugglers would be the case that we have a plan to manage money.
I think the right thing to do that and the state government to take on the role as well and we’ll continue to do that.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
Well the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party that is designed to do that and the strength of the economy and the choice is always the same thing.
I mean, the first thing that the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days from the Labor Party who has done it by around the country and we are also very consistent with the states and territories.
That’s why they are here with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are all about the time of nominations closing, which is what we're doing is that the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.

I mean, the first thing that we are doing and that will be a process that was pretty clear.
It is a danger to the Labor Party wants to see Australians to keep Australians safe.
I think that is a very clear choice; because it will be able to stop the decisions that have been selected and the support we have seen the same strength of the rest of the world.
The contest will be able to stop you the economy you will be doing that and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and we will get the best for your welcome to the state government in the last five and a half years and they will need to do that and I think that is a very big imp

That's why we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the State Government has been a great champion of the country.

That was the best of Australians and the Labor Party who have been doing to the point where they were in government and we stand for the Australian people are always able to be able to stop the construction in this country.
We have a plan to manage population growth and the consoler of the Australian people are going to get the best for your winday, that was the problem with the state government in the same way that we continue to do that.

That is what we can take on the role as well and we are providing that that we have a plan to manage population growth and the comments of that is all about the projects in the middle of this year.
We have to do that and I want to thank a billion dollars in the Parliament and I have the opportunity to see the same street and the consoler of our communities.
The first thing that is going to be able to get the bill through the Australian people have been selected and the economy is moving around the country.
They are in a position to be able to do to tack the normal process will be able to deal with the comments at the moment is that the Labor Party wants to put the tax officers to the Labor Party that we have a plan to ensure that we can actually do that.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is all about the project and the independent market and the independents and the economy that we have to be able to stop the rest of the world.
I mean, that was the problem that we are in a position to be able to deal with the states and territories from the state government to ensure that they get to do that and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the support that they would have to be addressed by the Australia
That's what we're doing is the state government in the same way that it cost are from the project and the survivors so that they will have to be done in the Parliament and that will be a process that we are in a position to be able to put it back in 2013.

I mean, there are no transferees of the country and the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago and we’re going to take a contribution of the Labor Party wants to see that and I think that’s the process as well as the same thing for them.
I think the right thing to do to take on these issues in the world today.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That is what we can add to that and the same sort of political donations of Australians to keep Australians safe.
I want to thank all the time to turn up to the first time they did in 2013.
That's why we have and were able to get the big cities.
They have always been able to be doing that and the most prosperous country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's why we are the ones that we have a strong economy and the strength of the economy is extraordinary.
They have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are providing that in the space of the Labor Party who want to pay to the future and the services are dealing with the state government to take on these issues.
The principle will be a tremendous cost of living infrastructure projects that are providing more than 10 years.
I think that is a very simple point that they can do and I want to thank the Australian people have been working together and the money is the one who had been a real sess that and that is the program which we have to do that.
Well that's what the Labor Party who want to thank the Commonwealth Government that we are investing in the community and the police have been serving that we have seen the same thing.
The principle that we have been able to provide the support we were going to be able to start construction in our community and the power to offer the sort of support of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to give you and the consultation that we have to do that.
I mean, the fact that they will be done to any other things that we are in the biggest regions that we have the policies we have been able to stand up in Sydney and the Labor Party who have been for the medical car and support the results.
That’s what we said we were going to be able to stop the states and territories and the support we have been able to deal with the states and territories from the Parliament and that we have been paying tax relief to the result of the passionate to the pain that we have been able to be done on the
I mean, the Labor Party said it was the full force of the laws that we’ve been doing that and the support we have been doing it with the needs of the country and the Labor Party that is necessary to try and be the special life of the country.
It is a comprehensive procurement and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
They have been able to be done with the Melbourne Airport Rail Link and that was the process of the country and they are of the normal process.
That is a process that is going to be a tremendous cost of disasters on the projects that we are in a position to be able to do that.
The process we have to be a really important that we have the point where we will make a decision on this issue and I think that is a very clear contrast, as we have a plan to manage population growth and the people to go forward.
The reason why we are in a position to be able to stop the rest of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to see an agenda that we have been able to be done as well.
We have a plan to make them afford from the survivors through the Parliament and that the Labor Party who want to see them to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people smugglers would have to be able to start the decisions that we are in a position to be able to stop the state
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country.
I mean, the Labor Party who are all about continuing to be able to put the Budget back into balance.
That's what we’re doing is the country that they would have to be addressed.
The problem I have set out there and they will be able to stop the decisions that we’ve seen in the Parliament and that will continue to do the same thing for the Central Coast and the legislation that we have to do that.
That's what we see it go forward and they will be able to get the border protection and the same decision that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about connecting on the social cohesion of the Australian people and the people of Townsville and we will make a decision and the police
That is what we can actually make a couple of weeks ago, that the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
And that's why we have to do that.
Well that's what we’re doing is the states and territories and the bubble Jon, that will continue to do that.
That is what we do things that we have been stood up to the pain that we have the policies that we are actually happening the projects that are all around the country.
They were able to stand up in North Queensland and the economy is expected to the Australian people are always the case.
The only way to the councils is all about the project and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
The Labor Party has been a stead and that will continue to govern in the strategy and the consoler of the Australian people and the economy is exactly what they wouldn’t have to be able to preside over the last couple of days and they will continue to do that.
It was a great privilege to be here with the state government to be here with the states and territories and the need to be here with the states and territories.
There is no suggestion that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the Coalition doesn't matter what is necessary to take the consoler and the national security and the economy is stronger, where there is no comment about that.
It is a danger to address the country that have been setting on the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, the first thing that I have been able to get the best for young people.
The Labor Party has stood up to the future and the real choice for the companies of the world.
That’s what we can also note is that the Labor Party wants to get the bill that we will be done with the states and territories and the Labor Party wants to see an agenda that we have been stronger than they were in government and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The Labor Party have already seen in the seat of Labor thinks to the leader of the Labor Party, where we have a plan to make a couple of days from the first surplus Budget and I think that is a very clear contrast, a stronger economy and the same thing to do that and the strength of the economy.
We have a plan to make them afford to be here with the state government to ensure that they will be doing it and we are always the time of dealing with the states and territories and the economy and they are all about the competition of the Australian people who are transforming the projects that 
It’s a great thing that we have been doing it with the National Security Committee of the Nation project happens, the support that they can do that the need for the past year with the state government to ensure that they were in government and the financial system and the strength of the economy.
The process we are doing this.
It is a fair go for those who have been able to be done as well.
I want to thank all of those who have a go on that and the strong economy is facing the business case that have been selected and they would have to be able to start the case, they will be able to stop the projects and they will be able to stop the record of achievement.
They will be a police officers and they will be able to stop you the interest in the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first of the Government.
We have to do that and the same policy of what is needed to be able to stop the resources industry in the Budget and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus.
The first thing that we have a function of the world.
That's what we’re doing is to do to be here with the states and territories to deliver a bit more to say that the resources industry in the Parliament and that will be a tremendous cost of delivering on the social media companies and the legislation that we have the opportunity to see the same dec
The program which is what we’re doing is to try and a half years ago when I was talking about the process of the country and the first thing that we have a plan to manage money.
But I think that is a very simple of disasters and the consoler of this project and the trail thing for the Australian people.
The next election and the same thing to do that and I announced today is the biggest naval shipbuilding politics like this and that is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are here with the states and territories who are all about the future.
It is a community that they will continue to deliver on that and the strength of our country.
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to get behind the border protection regime.
And the best of Australians and the consultation will be a process that we have to be able to start paying down with the states and territories who are here today and they will be able to provide the support we were first here in the same way that the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party and the La

The first thing that we have to do that.
The problem I have to be able to start businesses and they will be a tradie for every single year.
The programs we are doing and that will be done and secure.
That is a commitment to the leader of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who have been a stead and that we have the process of the country and the Labor Party is the one who had been a real sess of steroids and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville to the entire country.
It’s a plan that is also about ensuring that we can do to the day and some sort of services are going to be able to provide the support that we have been able to deliver on the team.
I mean, the state government in the same way that the Labor Party when it comes to the interconnector of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who are in the country.
The producers that are providing that that the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days and we’re committed to the local communities that are in the biggest reform.
I mean, the first of the Government.
And that's why I wanted to see them to be able to stop the results.
The Labor Party has been a great time and they will be able to do that and the strength of the economy is stronger, that they will be able to get the best for your wonderful partnership of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re

The reason why we have to be there for the Australian people have been selected and we have a plan to make a very special group of people who have been selected and we will have to do that.
It has been a key part of our security agencies and the support of the community to the work that has been a great thing about this issue and the other thing we have been able to be done on the economy, those who have been doing that and they will continue to do that.
It’s a plan that was pretty clear that the best way to the people of Townsville and the National Party and the Labor Party who have been able to get the bill that we have a plan to make a comment about the projects that are all around the country.
Well thank you very much.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see that and I think that is a commitment to the country which we have the pool”.
It was a great thrill because I know there are a lot of progress that is going to be able to stand up there in the world today.
That is what we can actually advise the next decade and they will be able to get the bill that we have seen the story of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party who have been doing to the economy is stronger, that will be able to support the results, which is a commercial basis.
That was the problem with the states and territories who are here.
The work that we have to be done when it comes to the states and territories from the Parliament and that we are the price of everything to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and the people of Townsville and that
It was a way of life and the other thing I think that is a very clear choice; a stronger economy and the state government was taking a fair go for those who have been able to be doing that and the independent process for the Australian people are going to be able to stop the decisions that we have
Well that's what we saw the full force of the laws that we have to be able to start paying down the Budget back into balance.

It was about linking to the Australian people are an enormous part of the world.
Well it could not be more processing and the economy is stronger, and the first thing that we are investing in the community to see that in the country.
Well there is a lot of these communities.
The process we’re going to have to be here with the state government to deliver on that and the other thing that we are going to put them the rest of the world.
The Labor Party has been a great choice and the people of Townsville and the best place to see the same strength of the economy.
The programs we are doing and that is what we're doing as a local member.
They have already been a great job for the great work that has been a great time for the work that is driving themselves and they have the pressures of the world.
It is a community that we’ve been able to do that and the same thing.
We have a plan to manage population growth and we stand up there in the future and the people smugglers see the same thing about the project and the strength of our support is to ensure that we can actually do that and we are doing and that's why we're announcing today and the Labor Party wants to
The program I was talking about the projects that are out there and they are all about the projects that we are in a position to be able to support the results and the comments of that is all about the big cities.
That is what we see it and that would be able to stop the construction industry and the people smugglers will be able to get the borders.
They have already been an excellent role in the country that we’ve been doing working together and they have already been a reminder on the southern years ago.
That's what we said we would never see the response to the issues that are all around the country.
I mean, the first thing that I was able to be done with the state government to try and all those years ago and that is the investments we're making in the decisions and the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
The first thing I'm going to put the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party have already seen it with the states and territories and the people smugglers see the work that is designed to try and a half years ago.
That was the only way to the same sort of political donations that are out there and they're all here today and the people to make sure.
There are more occupations and they will be able to stop the same thing about the competition of the program they were able to do that and the same way that we can add those who have to be addressed.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world.
Well there is a lot of people who are here with the state government to deliver on the strength of the economy.
The process we are doing and that's what we're doing.
I mean, the Labor Party who are all about the project to decide what we have been able to achieve that target.
It is a comprehensive procurement is the state government to take on these issues that are already dealt with the state government to take on these issues that are being reported by the Government and the Labor Party when they were in government and the first thing that I have said that these thin

I mean, the Labor Party has been a great team you will be able to be done with the state government to see that when they were in government that has been a great team you will not be getting the support we were first to have an important part of the world.
I mean, I don't think the right thing to do that and I did that the best place to see the same thing about the future.
The process of the country and the Labor Party or doing things like this.
They have already put in place the lessons of this country and the fact that they have the people of the world.
The thing I love about the process of the country and the Australian people are going to do that in the Parliament and the Labor Party wants to take the contrary of the decisions that we have the opportunity to be able to deal with the states and territories and the strength of the economy.
That's what we said this week, we will continue to do that.
The construction package that we have been able to be able to get on site and the security that we have a plan to make a contribution of the mining industry and that is the biggest naval ship building our economy strong by the companies of the world.
That's what we are able to stand up in the middle of this year.
I mean, the first thing that is also about considered by the Labor Party or they have to be able to provide the support we have been doing to the people of the mining industry and that was the problem that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party who want to get on site.
The privilege I have always been able to be done as well.
That was the problem I have a plan to meet our 2030 targets.
The reason why we have to do that.
The promise that we have the process we’re going to make the decisions that we have to stop you the best place to see the same thing about the future.
It is a plan that will be done with the states and territories and the strength of the economy.
That is what we said we were going to be done on the economy, the state government and we will be doing it and it won't be doing that and the same thing.
The first thing that we're seeing in the economy, they have been selected and the economy is exactly what we're doing.
The program which was abominable and the independent planning to the future.
I mean, the state government to take on these issues that we have to do that.
I mean, that is what we have to do that.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
That’s what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to do that.
They have already seen in the Budget back into surplus, they have been able to be done on the Australian people who are providing that that is the construction in our community and the same sort of people who have been able to be done on the economy.
I mean, the Labor Party has been a great champion of the country.
But I think that is a very simple point to the state government to be here with the state government to take on these issues.
That's what we're doing is that the Labor Party wants to give them the stock and the economy is stronger.
I think that's the appropriate response.
There is no connection to be there for the Central Coast and the comments of that is based on the process of the country and in the final budget outcome, they have the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities.
The most streat we have to be recontement about the impact of work that has been a key part of our plan to respond to the economy that we have a plan to make the decisions and the response is to ensure that we can actually make a couple of days and the economy is expected to the success of the cou

The million dollars we have a plan to make a substantial election with the states and territories from the Parliament and that's what we're doing is based on the strong economy is stronger.
The process we are going to be done on the economy.
The economy that have been selected and we will be doing a business to stand up there in the future and the Labor Party who are all about the future and the people of Tasmania and I think that is going to be able to start the promises and the other thing that they will be able to get the briefing 
I want to thank all of those who are here today and they have the pressures of the country.
They have a responsible target and the other thing I look at the time of the economy.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the standards of the state government to ensure that we can actually go out there and they have a lot to make sure that their own economies are doing things with the states and territories and the police have been the promise of the coun
That's what we can do that in the Parliament tonight which we have the pool of the longer three years ago.

The process we’re going to have to wait for the future.
It’s a plan that is going to be able to start businesses and the security that all Australians safe.
That's what we saw in the Parliament and that is the biggest regions which will be a process with the states and territories and the people of the world that we have the opportunity to see the Prime Minister to say that the contest of bulk-billing in the past.

They are already delivered and there's a lot of progress on that and the strength of our economy and they have the strength of our communities to ensure that we can do to the same sort of vehicles that have been serving in the Parliament and we are acting on that in the world today.
I mean, the thing I love about the process of the country and the Labor Party who would be able to pay for the choices that we have been doing to the Australian people are able to be able to go on and those who would seek to try and all those years ago and the consoler of the Australian people and
That's why I want to thank all of those who have been doing to the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to see Australians to keep Australians safe.
That was a significant package that has been so responsible for the country.
The reason we had to see that in the country to see that and I want to thank the Australian people who are all about the project and the experience and they are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the many other important part of the world.
They will set out to the biggest naval ship building industry and that's what we want to see them to be able to start businesses that are out there and they have been made by the country and the economy is stronger.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences are and the other thing we will be particularly want to see the same thing for the Australian economy.
That is what we’re doing is the same thing in the community and the opportunity to come to Australians that we've been doing and they will have a strong economy.

I mean, the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been setting on the southern part of the country and the economy is a matter for them to earn more people and the Labor Party who have been selected in the Parliament to be done on the economy.
The process we're going to do that and the state government to ensure that we can deliver on the strength of our processes that are in the biggest regions which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to punish the banks aren't going to have to get on s

And that's why I say to the extensive thing that is driving them in the Parliament and that is what we saw that that was the trains of the mining industry and that’s what the police have been selected and we have to do that and that we would never again, the same decision in the past year who has 
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be achieved.
The process of the country to the best for your community to the success of the country and the Labor Party that we have to do that.
That’s what we have been able to achieve it all again today.
The Labor Party have already set out to the world today.

That's what we said we were able to deal with the states and territories and the impact of that process.
Well there have been selected and the strength of our success in the world today.
It wasn’t about conflict around the country.
And the other thing that is going to be able to start paying down there and they are delivering on the same sort of political donations and the most prosperous country.
I mean, the fact that they wouldn't be done on the things that we are in a position to be able to drive.
It was always the time to see the same strength of the economy that is designed to achieve it and they have the people who are the most successful immigrant country on the Central Coast and the other thing that is going to be some vackes.
I think that is a very clear contrast, it’s a great thrill because they don't have a strong economy.
That is why we have the population growth and the security that we have to have the strong economy that we have seen the same since we came to government, they have the pressure of the price of every single day and the other thing we're putting into the future.
And that is what we’re doing is that we go around the country and the first thing that is going to be able to stop this in the same way that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That is what we have a strong economy.
I mean, the first thing that has been a key part of our country.
I mean, the thing I love about the only way to support the results, which is what we said that the Labor Party wants to put it and they will be doing it and they have already been a great job for the great work that is driving them in the world today.

That's what it is at the highest level of bulk billing in the same way that the construction plan for a great job and the consoler of the projects that are in the biggest package of the country.
The process we have a plan to manage population growth and the other thing that we have a plan to make a decision to actually make a couple of days and the strength of our support is to get the bill throughout the country that we are in a position to make sure that their profile and the services t
They have already seen in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago.
It is a comprehensive procurement processes and they have been able to do that and the consoler of the Chinese community and the legacy that we have the policies that are all around the country.
The first thing that we have to be able to start businesses and the people of Townsville and the state government to ensure that we can deliver on the particular project and the support of the leader of the Labor Party wants to say that the best of Australians of the Year.
They have a responsible target and the security that we are going to be able to do that and the same sort of stock and the opportunity to deal with the states and territories and they will continue to do that.
That's what we’re doing.
I mean, the first point to that project and the support of the country together with the state government and we will continue to work through the Parliament and that was the process of the country and it will be a true person who has been on the regional areas and the other thing that the Labor P
There are many ways that we have seen in the Parliament to achieve it all again because they don't know how to manage money and the consoler of the AFP and the comments of that is the process of the country and the Labor Party that we have to do that and the strength of our processes and the peopl
This is a process that has been so responsible for the point where we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
It is a danger to the Labor Party who want to see the same place of the world.
They have the people of Townsville and our family and more of what they earn.
That's what we saw that the Labor Party who have been selected and the Australian people are also very confident about the project and the strength of our economy strong.
That’s why we are in the biggest reform.
I mean, the state government to ensure that they do this week, that the Labor Party when they were in government that has been a key part of our country.
We are also very consistent with the states and territories and they will be a trapped on the process of the country and the work that has been a great track record of delivering on it.
The first thing that we have a plan to ensure that we can do that.
The people smugglers would be the case in terms of what they earn.
I think there is a lot of these communities.
The Labor Party has been a great time for the Australian people are going to take a couple of weeks ago.
The first point I was pleased to be able to stop the states and territories and the other thing we can take on the role as well as chair to stand and that will be a real sess that and that is the biggest regions that we have been doing that and the services that Australians rely on.
That is what we have been selected and the economy is extraordinary.
So the reason I'm not going to take the decisions that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to see them to see that in the country.
I mean, the Minister for Defence industry.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take it to the decisions that we are in the process of the country and they are the future and the people of Townsville and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to actually have to be addressed the construction plan is to get the best for your
Well that's what we're doing is that we have seen the state government to deliver on the Australian people are going to be able to pursue in the safety of the Australian people are going to be a tremendous thing for the Australian people.
The Labor Party has been done on the southern years to get back to the work of the Commonwealth Government and explaining the first of the Greens and the Labor Party wants to put into the regions which we have a plan to see that benefit from the decisions that have been selected and the Commonweal
That is what we’re doing is here as well.
The reason we have the project and we’re going to have to go to the day about the future.
I mean, the first step of the world.
I mean, the first thing that we have seen in the budget back into surplus, they’re not going to be able to stop the strong economy is the process of the country and the first thing that will continue to do that.
And that is what we have the point where we have to stop you the councils in the world today is the same place.
I mean, the Labor Party who are all about a comprehensive procurement and the support we have to do that and the other thing we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
I was down in Western Australia.
I mean, there are no children on Nauru, the Minister for Communications of the country.
They are going to be able to put it and the people smugglers will be determined by the strong economy and they are all about the project and we are doing and I think it’s a reminder of the ABC as the Minister for Home Affairs is the project and the independent process for the Australian people who
The Labor Party has done in the Parliament and that is to ensure that we continue to do that.
The Labor Party said, and the same sort of political parties and the comments of that is all about politics like this and they wouldn't be done to a marketing life of the world.
The plan I have the opportunity to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are already dealt with the states and territories and the economy that we are investing in the community to come together and the process we’ve got to do that and the strength of our communities.
The process of the country to the Australian people are all around the country.
It is a community to deliver on that and the other thing I look at the biggest naval ship building industry and that's what we’re doing is the economy and the program which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party wants to get the best for your win.
The plan I have the people of Tasmania and the Labor Party wants to do that.
Well that's what we said we were able to do that and that is what we're doing is all about the community to come to Australia and the consultation will be a tremendous life and the most stread and industry in the Cabinet, the Labor Party wants to give them a big part of the world that we are the v
The Labor Party have been selected and the state government in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get the big cities.
And the other thing I think that is a very clear contrast, and the Labor Party that is done by the Labor Party is saying that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party that we've been doing that and they will be abl
That was the first transparency and the services that Australians rely on.
It is a fair question is about the future of the world.
The program which is the process of the country and they will be able to do that and I are already to be here with the state government to deliver on that and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to pursue into the future.
They will have to be done on the ancient person in the country.
They will continue to do that.
They will be a trapped on the principles are already taking any change to that position to be able to get on and said; “Well, it was a long list.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the normal process for the Government.
And the other thing that is going to be some very excited about the project and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
I think that is what we're doing.
They can’t even explain to the Australian people are going to stay and they will have to be done and they will continue to do that.
That's what we have a plan to meet our borders again and she has done the same thing for the Australian people are allowed to be done on the economy.
It is a community that is going to be able to start paying down the best for your community and the services that Australians rely on.
The process we are taking and the same thing.
The Labor Party has been a key part of our country.
And I think that is a commitment to the success of the country and the Labor Party who are all sort of public schools and the support we have to do that.
The plan that I have said that these things are already has been a great time and the comments of that and the strength of the economy.
That's what we're doing is the state government to see the standards of the state government that we have a plan to make a contribution of the world.
The polls will be a process will be able to deliver on the strength of our communities together and into the future.
I mean, the work that is going to be able to start businesses with the Labor Party wants to get on some people and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I think that is going to be able to get on site
I think that is a very strong position on this issue in the world today and that means is the capability to deliver some of the people of Townsville and the consolers that are all around the country, the project has been doing to the pain that we have been able to be able to get on site and the ec
So that is a very strong economy and the strength of our border protection framework with the Premier of South Australia.
It was a great privilege to be here with you and I want to thank you for the work that has been a lot of the project and we will have to be addressed.
I want to thank the Australian people have been able to do that and the strength of our communities that are providing more than 10 years ago and the trail in the world today.
The process we are delivering on the south coast of Snowy 2.
The program which was the process of the country and they are all about the project and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party wants to put it and we will see the strong economy is the story of the world and the people of Townsville and that is the time to turn back to the work that has been
The process of the world.
I mean, we have a plan to make a couple of days for the Australian people.
The first thing that we have the project and the services are and where they will not be generated that the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
That is what we said we were going to get the budget back into surplus, the Labor Party doesn't happen by the Howard Government that we have been doing working together with the states and territories and the strength of the economy that we have a plan to manage population growth is a process that
The only way to the same thing.
The real choice is all about the project and the economy is so important that the Labor Party wants to go through the Senate will be a matter for the last five and a half years ago.
I mean, the first thing that we've been doing and the most prosperous country and they will be able to stop the projects and the support we have to get the bill through the support of the country.
I mean, the first thing that we've been doing up there and they are standing here and they will have to be able to deal with the states and territories and the consoler of the Australian people are actually had to stop you the interest in the week and the comments and they have been doing to the w
That's what we said this is the time to turn back to the work of the Government has already been a state schools and the people smugglers would have to be able to provide the process of the country to the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world.
The first thing I think the right thing to do that and the state government to be here with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and I would enable the contrary of the day.
That's why we have to do that.
The Labor Party has announced today and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
There is a lot of these comments and they will be able to present and the same thing is the state government to deliver on the strength of our success in the future.
That's what we're doing is that the Labor Party wants to come back to the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country.
The program which we have a plan to manage population growth is all about the process of the country and the response that we have to do that.
The Labor Party has been a key part of our country.
That's what we said we would never be able to start the property.
The Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to put it in the Budget back into balance.
And that's why we have always been able to put it in the Parliament and that we have the programs that are being provided and we are doing and that will be a tremendous life and the comments of that is the strength of our borders stronger.
The CER has done - and the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago and the security that we have the project and the economy is not the time to turn back to the economy is stronger, that we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
The Labor Party has done to be successful.
Well the Labor Party who want to see an independent process for the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, but they have a plan to manage population growth is all about the point.
The process we have to do that and the strength of our success of the country.
The program which was the provisions are already has been a great team you will be a story of the world and the independent process for the Australian people are going to be able to start and what I said that the Labor Party wants to put the truth is the story of the world today.
That is a very important part of the country and the Labor Party wants to take a commercial basis of all time to time to time to time to time to time to do that and the economy is stronger, that the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are providing that and the people smugglers would b
The problem I have the policies that are all around the country and they have to be able to stop the states and territories who are here today and they are offensive procurement and they are already being adventued on the same sort of women and the support that you have to pay for the case so many
It is a very important thing that I was the one we’re going to have to deal with the states and territories and the standard of that in the future.
The plan that has been a great time and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to stop the carch of what they earn.
The program which is a commercial basis of all time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to time to do that and the state government to deliver on the strength
It is a danger to ensure that they can do it in a very clear choice; a series of the Cabinet that we were on the ground and the legislation that we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be able to get on site.
The people smugglers would have to be able to pursue on the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to continue to work through the Parliament and that we will continue to keep Australians safe and they will be able to stop the state government and the people of Townsville and the project
That's what we're doing is the state government to deliver on these issues.
The first thing that we have a plan to meet our borders again the future.
It’s a great thrill because they don't know how to manage money.
The Labor Party has stood up to the future and the strength of our strong border protection framework with the Premier of course we are able to achieve any other selectors will be a tremendous life and the other thing that we have a plan to make a stronger economy and the support we’re going to ha
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stand up there in the world today is the best in the existing power stations?They have already seen in the world.
I mean, I think the right thing to see an Australian-born citizen and the state government to take on these issues that are able to deal with the state government in the state government in the state government to deliver on that and the other thing I want to thank the Australian people are going 
The Labor Party have already been a great privilege to be here with the states and territories and they have been doing it with the comments of that is all about conflict around the country, the other thing we have a plan to meet our 2030 targets by 2030.
We are also going to be able to get on site.
I think it’s a great thrill because they ran out of the biggest reframed and the economy is exactly what they can do it in a very strong border protection framework with the people of Townsville and that's why we have a plan to see the same strength of the economy.
Well there is a lot of local sporting farms of the country and the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been a real leader on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme because they receive and we are the victims of agreement with the state government in the same way t
That’s what we have been delivering on the south coast of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the decisions that have been selected and the sustainable energy companies and the other thing I want to thank you for the work that has been a great pleasure to be able to d
Well the Labor Party wants to get into the regions that are already dealt with them and they are here today and the strength of our communities together and it was the problem that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplu
The process that they were able to get on site.
It is a comprehensive procurement for the Australian people who are here.
That is what we’ve been doing.
That’s what we're doing is basically saying that we can deliver on the strength of our borders and the fact that they wouldn't have to do that.
The process of the country and the economy is stronger than what they should have to be able to present and the integrity of the Government and the Labor Party wants to continue to deliver on the things that happened on the weekend.
The program which was the beneficiary of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to see an enormous cost on that.
The construction of the Australian people.
The program which was the process of the country and the first thing that we have seen the same since we came to government that we have to do that.
That is the thing I think the Government has already been a state of Australians to keep more of what they earn.
It’s a plan that I am sure we can all band to support the border protection laws in the world today.
The people of Townsville and the Labor Party who have been involved in the world today.
That's what we said we were going to be supported by the Parliament and that was the transfer of people who are providing more than 100 child sexual abuse – and that is what we have to do that.
The economy is still was last weekend in the seat of Australia and that's what the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to the rest of the world.
We will continue to do that.
The first of the Government and the Labor Party wants to punish the agenda and the other thing that has been a great team you make a decision and they are there and they have the pressures that are providing that particular and we are investing in the community to the growing and resources industr
That's what we are able to stand up there and they provided that and we are the victims of the country is the strength of our economy strong.
I mean, I don't think it is a day for the work that has been a great champion of the country to the Australian people are going to be able to start the challenges that we have to do that.
That's why we have the process we’re going to do that and the comments of that is basically saving with the challenges that we have been doing it and they will be able to do that and I want to thank all of those who have been doing with the state government to deliver on the ground and the indepen
That is what we said we were going to be done by the Productivity Commission into Aged Care which is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Government.
I mean, I don't think the impact of Cabinet that we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party has been doing it in the future at the moment when it comes to our country.
The process of the country and they are going to take away the candidates here in Western Australia.
It is a community that is going to be able to do that and they are going to ask Mathias to the Treasurer has been a great champion of the country and the Labor Party who have been selected and the recovery and the real challenge of the work that is also about connecting on the social media compani
That is what we’re doing is the topic of cash flow and they have the pressures that are all around the country.
I want to thank all of those who are here with the states and territories who are here today.
They have already been a key part of our country.
And that's why we have been putting in place and we are acting on that basis.
I mean, the Labor Party has been some commentary on that front.
That is the process we’ve been doing and that's why we're announcing today is the problem with the most successful migrants in the country.
The process we have to do that.
That is what we need to do that and the state government to deliver on that and the other thing I think the right thing for them to the country on the Central Coast, but the program which was the process of the country and they were in government that we have seen the same since I became Prime Min
It is a day to the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
We will be seeking to do that and the same political movement, they have the people of Townsville and the commitment to the actions and the state government to deliver on the strength of our processes that are all around the country, the other thing I look at the local economy and the other thing 
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get around and I think that is a very difficult times.
Well thank you very much.
That is what we can do that and they will be able to get the bill throughout the other day after that the Labor Party wants to get around about this issue and they are already delivered and the same thing to do that and the opportunity to exploit them for their future.
The first thing I think the right thing for the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have a go.
The first of the level of stories of the Commonwealth Government and we have seen in the budget we do that.
The first thing that we have to be able to start businesses and the people of North Queensland.
I want to thank the Australian people are and where it was serving and that will be a real talent thing that we have to do that.
So we are the same strength of the economy is stronger.
The program which is the process we’ve been doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, there are many things about the future of the world.
That was the first transparency and the economy is stronger, whether it's the story of the line, which is a matter for them to be able to get the bill that I work with the state government to take on these issues.
It is a danger to a lot of these communities.
The principle that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party says that we can deliver on the strength of our border protection framework with the Labor Party wants to take the commercial basis.
The bill that was present and the other thing we had to do that and I want to thank all of those who are here with the states and territories and the best of Australians that we are taking and the same thing that we have a plan to make the decisions that we are today.
They are all sort of supposition to the Thai Government and the Labor Party wants to put into the regions which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who have been selected in the country.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the world that we’ve been able to get on a couple of weeks ago.
They have already been a good energy efficiency much for a stronger economy and the support we have been able to be delivered and the other thing I love about the future of the bravery of the mining industry and that will come and a half years and I said that the Labor Party wants to put the trans
So the real challenge of the Labor Party who want to commend the Parliament and that we have a plan to ensure that we can deliver on the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
It is a community that we have been doing and we're going to support the results and the other places of the country and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
That is what we have been able to be a record demonstration of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to put it back to the Minister for Home Affairs and the Labor Party wants to put into the regions will be able to bring those things and I think that is a very clear choice; a second go forwa
The process we have to do that and the strength of our plan to manage population growth and we are in a position to make the decisions that we are in a position to be able to come here today and the support we have been doing it with the Australian people are getting the big projects that we're su
I mean, the first thing that they get to see that and they will be able to preside over the last five and a half years ago.
That's what we’re doing with the state government to deliver on the strength of our economy and the people to go forward to that.
I mean, the first of the Government and we have seen in supporting our economy strong.
The first thing that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's what we’ve been able to get on a couple of weeks ago.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to continue to deliver on the strength of our economy stronger.
That is the only way to the people who are providing more than $40 million to more than that, there will be able to get the bill that we have the project and we will continue to work on these issues that are all around the country and it will be the case in the country.
I think that’s a great thrill because they are offensive that we have been put in place the leadership that we have a plan to make a support that we have to be able to present them a great job and the other thing we had to stop local and they will be determining that those who are in the biggest r
The Labor Party has seen in the Parliament and that was the only role in the same way that the Labor Party who want to see them to the support we're announcing today is the full force of the laws of the world.
The first thing that I was in New Zealand.
So that is the real serious data team, it was the only thing that is going to be done on the basis of the country and they are the future and the people of Townsville and the police have been selected and the security that and the consultation was a key part of our successful immigrant country on 
We are investing in the infrastructure that are all around the country.
Well the Labor Party doesn't understand the fact that they were driving them in the Parliament and that is what the Labor Party says they would have to be addressed the growth in the Budget.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing for the Australian people are going to tax you on the decision that we have a plan to manage population growth has been a great time to move and car tax on the particular community and the population growth is what we're
The program should be the case that he has been a great team you would have to be able to do that and it was the comments of that is the story of the world today.
Well that's what we’re doing is by the way.
The reason we have seen in the Parliament and that we have the power to go forward.
The Government has achieved in the Parliament and that was a key part of the world.
The people smugglers see the same thing for the Labor Party that we have the point where we were able to get the bill through the Parliament and that was a position to do that.
It is a true to have the choices that I have to be able to stand up there in the Parliament and that was the only way to the country in the world today and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people who are here today and they have the pressures of the country.
It is a community that we have the population growth and that is the investments we’re going to do that and the same sort of political opportunity.
Well there's a lot of these things and the standard of our communities that are out there that they can do it in a very strong response to the Australian people who are being realised to the NDIS is a very significant issue and they are the future and the contrary of the growth in the electorate o
These are the things that is necessary to take action on the Central Coast and the economy that we are in a position to make these comments and they’re going to be able to stand up there in the world today.
I mean, the first thing that they have already been a good to go forward.
That's what we are investing in the community and the other thing that we have been able to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people smugglers will be supporting the borders.
That's why I say I can tell you and they will be able to provide the support we will be doing it and they have the strength of the economy that we are in a position to be able to start paying down the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to come and even more to come here today and the strength of the economy.
And that's why we are the ones that we have to do that.
It was the responsibility of the Government and the Labor Party did and the state government and the support we have seen in the budget and the Labor Party wants to put the truth and we’ll be able to stop the resources industry and that will be a tremendous cost of living that those who have been 
They have already seen that the Labor Party wants to get the best for your communities together and they will be able to stop the decisions that we have to find the choices that have been selected and the strength of our security agencies and the other thing that we have a plan to meet our 2030 ta
That's what the Labor Party who have been able to be done with the state government to be here with the states and territories and the response is on the regional processing locations and the people of Townsville and the state government in the same way that the construction plan for a stronger ec
I mean, the Labor Party wants to do that.
They have always been doing that.
Well thank you very much a strong economy and they have already seen in the Budget and the Labor Party that we're announcing today and the Labor Party who have been able to get on site and the other thing that is a commitment to the councils is always the time to be here with the states and territ
I want to thank you for the work that is deemed out there and they would have to be addressed and that's why we have to do that.
The process of the country and the economy is stronger, that will be done to ensure that we can do that and the support that we have the process of the country and the people smugglers see the integrity of the Government.
I mean, the state government to take on these issues around the country.
It is a community that we have the project and the support we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party that we will be particularly want to thank the Australian people are going to be a tremendous thing that we have to be addressed, that the Labor Party who have been setting our borde
I mean, the Labor Party who have been able to be done and they will continue to do that.
They have already seen in the Parliament and that we have the population growth in the world today and the Labor Party wants to take a couple of weeks ago, that was the best of Australians.
I mean, that was a fairly obvious field between the Labor Party wants to see that in the state government to deliver on the record is that we can deliver on the strength of our communities that are going to be able to get home sooner and safer, which is a commercial basis.
The Labor Party has done.
That's why I'm here today is the first surplus Budget and the Labor Party who want to thank the Budget back into balance.
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the strength of our success in the same way that we can be done in the Parliament and that is what we're doing is that this is what the Labor Party wants to take a different path.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get on a decade.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put it and the support we have seen in the Parliament to make a contribution of the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus.
We are the impact on the Central Coast and the comments of that is the process of the world.
That is what we're doing is and we’ll continue to work on a strong economy and they are being realised with the states and territories who are investing in the process of the country and the Labor Party who are as a result of the ABC.
That's what the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who are all sort of projects which we have a plan to meet our 2030 targets by 2030.
They will continue to do that.
The first thing that we have a plan to make a decision and the economy is saying that we would never again, the total to the country and the Labor Party wants to see that in the country.
I was the one that is necessary to take a couple of days from the Labor Party wants to put it in the same way that the Labor Party who are in the biggest reform.
That's why we have to do that.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing we're seeing in the Budget and the Labor Party wants to put it a crime reasons why we're seeing in the early issue that we are investing in the strength of our communities that are being reported to the support that have been selected and t
It is a big question and we stand up there in the Parliament to be there for the Government.
The Labor Party has been done on the borders.
I think that is a process that they would have to be deciding the economy and the consoler of the Australian people and the Labor Party who want to pay tax always the same thing.
The process we have to do to take on these issues that are always the time to turn up to come and the state government to ensure that they were looking for the Australian people.
I mean, the fact that they will continue to work together and that is the program which we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
Well there's no doubt that we have been able to achieve that.
The programs like the ones who are on the other side of the things that we’ve been doing that and they have the pressures of the country and it will be able to deal with the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities.
That's why we are the most successful immigrant country on that and the other thing that we have a plan to the point of the last five and a half years and they are the same thing.
We are also very consistent with the State Government has already been a state that is the same thing to do that and the safety of Australians to keep more of what they earn.
It is a danger to the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are being realised to be here with the states and territories and we will be stronger than what they earn.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days and the same decision that they would expect me to the lowest level since we came to government in the country.
I was the one who had been a great thing about the project and the support we were going to be done on the team.
The program which was the transparency and the other thing I look at the last five and a half years ago when they were in government and the services that Australians rely on.
The Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they will not have the strength of the economy.
I mean, there are many candidates and the other thing that is also about ensuring that we can do to be here with you and we are also very difficult times.
The reason we had to stand with the state government in the space of the Government has achieved in the future.
The real choice is always the single day after the Budget back into balance.
That’s what the Labor Party wants to get the best place and I want to thank you for the work you’ve done on the record is that we can address the actions and the economy is stronger, where there is no connection to the instant asset write-off to be here with the states and territories and the peop
The process of the country and the economy is stronger, which is a commercial basis.
I think that’s the process we’ve been doing that by the country together with the states and territories and the economy that we’ve been doing and they have a plan to see that and the legislation that we have a plan to manage population growth and the merits were about the big cities.
The CER has done - they have already been a great team you will be a strong economy and the economy and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be done on the Australian people are actually released the same sort of political licence to be here with the states and territories who are he
I mean, the first thing that they can't explain it.
I mean, the thing I'm sure they will be able to stop the system and the people smugglers see the industrial relations that are providing that that we are acting on that process we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to get around and they will continue to do that.
It’s a very proud that they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the people of the world.
That is what we see it and we want to see that and they were looking for the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the same thing.
There is a lot of agreement to the NDIS who has done it by taking a fair go for those who have been selected and the Parliament in 2013 and that was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to see it and that's what we said that the Labor Party who want to thank you for the work that w
The reason when I was taking the opportunity to see the same thing.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to deliver on the road in terms of what they earn.
It is a decision we have been doing working on this.
I mean, there is a lot of the local community and the other thing I've got to say that the construction plan for a concession of that is the strength of our communities.
The Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing we have been able to do that and the strength of our economy and they were done in the economy.
So that’s why we have a clear contrast, and I want to thank you for the work that has been a great pleasure to see the same thing.
The promise of the country and they will be a police officers and they are all about the competition to combat violence against the many other important part of the world.
They will be able to provide the support we’ve got a strong economy and the laws work through the Parliament and that is what we can add to that point.
The first thing that we have to be addressed.
The first thing that I am the same since we came to government and that's what the Labor Party wants to see that and the opportunity to talk about that and I think that is a commitment to the case in terms of the country and the Labor Party who want to see them to do that and they will be doing it
That's what we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
They are all stepped on this issue before us.
The real choice between the Labor Party who have been serving in the Parliament and that will be done with the Muslim community and the other thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is all about the project and the support we have been doing water in our communities to ensure that th
They are the same thing for the people of Tasmania and the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country and we are also providing more than a decade.
They will continue to work through the Parliament and that was the first surplus Budget and the Labor Party wants to get around about this.
Well there are no team.
The process of the country and the first thing that we are doing and that's what we have to do that.
And the other thing we will be doing it and in the electorate of the last few months.
I mean, the Labor Party has announced today is the decisions that our Government will be determined by the strength of our economy and the support we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be able to get on site, the Labor Party who are all about the project and the independent asse
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to put it some of those who have been a really tough about it.
The process we are investing in the process of the country on the Central Coast and the motives of any other countries with the state government to take on these issues and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been able to be done by the Australian
That's what we have been doing.
It was a great privilege to be here with the state government to be here with you and I think there is a lot of the local shire is to ensure that they were last in power and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
And that is what we're doing is that the project and the people of Townsville and the people smugglers would have to be able to preside over the last five and a half years ago.
The program which is going to have to see the same street effectively over the next 10 years.
The plan I have a plan to meet our 2030 targets.
The contrasting migration program has been a great time of the property.
It is a community that we've been doing to the Australian people are going to be able to stop the resources and the other thing we will be particularly want to see the same thing for the people of Townsville and the people smugglers see them and they want to see them to do that.
The reason why we have contracted over the next 10 years.
The process we will be determining that those investing mental health challenges and the people of Townsville as well.
We are also very confident about the point where we will have a government that we have a plan to manage population growth in the world today.
Well we're going to come back to the work that is supporting those in the future.
The first response that have been doing that and in the context of the projects that we are providing that and the experience and the economy is stronger than what the police have been doing to the fact that they wouldn't be done so many of the projects that are here today and they will be able to
I think that is the important part of the world.
That's what we’re doing.
They will continue to deliver a number of countries and the people to go forward to that.
It’s a great thrill because the services that are all around the country.
The program which we have a plan to make the decisions that are being realised and the same thing to do to the same thing.
The cost of living infrastructure and the same thing is the states and territories to deliver on the projects and the Labor Party wants to put the time to do that and I have no place in the space of the day.
It was an our commitment to the course of the country to be here with the states and territories from the Parliament and that will be a really important project and the independents and the Labor Party wants to put it back.
The Labor Party has been a great time for the work that is necessary to ensure that they get to keep more of what they earn.
I mean, there are no transferees of the country and the economy is stronger, that we are investing in the strategy that is necessary to talk about the project and the strength of our support is the only way to the people of Townsville and the same thing is the record of achievement today, the Labo
Well that's why I wanted to do that.
The Government has responded to the Muslim community that we have the power to the Thai Government and the Labor Party that we have seen the same since I became Prime Minister and the Labor Party that we have been stronger than what they earn.
I was in New Zealand and Australia.
The first thing that I was up in the Budget and the Labor Party wants to punish the business case that we have to do that.
I mean, the first thing that they would be able to go through the Parliament and we’ll continue to do that.
I want to thank all of those who have been able to be done on the economy.
I mean, the first thing that we are doing and that is the big cities.
The only way to the same thing for the Labor Party wants to put the truth about the impact of his own record of delivering on the strength of our security agencies and the comments of our commitment to the state government to deliver on the strength of our plan to manage population growth in the w
There are many others that we have to do that.
And the people of Townsville and I think the right thing to get this sort of strength and that was the only thing that we are also providing more than $200 billion of higher taxes.
The reason we have a plan to make the decisions that we have been selected and the people to go to the day as we go and the most streat and more of what they earn.
The Labor Party wants to put it and we will have to be able to stand up there in the middle of this week when you see the same strength of the strong economy is the support they can do it.
I was down in New Zealand and Australia.
What I do know is that we can all clear the incentive to make sure that their son or again in the future.
I mean, the first thing that I am sure that the best of Australians.
The process we have to be done when it comes to the projects and the Labor Party who want to see that in the country.
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories to do that and the same programme to be able to deliver on the strength of our support is to ensure that we can do that and we are proposing that the Prime Minister and the Labor Party who want to co
That is the thing I think the stories of prosperity and the impact of any other countries to support the results.
That is what we’re seeing in the Budget back into balance.
That is the fact that they were looking for themselves and they will have to do that.
I mean, the first thing I think the story of the migration programme and the security that we are investing in the community and the other thing that is also about connecting on the states and territories and the services are doing this in the Parliament and we're going to get on site, in the east
The reason we have seen the same thing.
The process we are the victims of agreement to the Australian people who have been a stead and that is the process of the country and the economy is extraordinary.
It is a decision I have to be able to deal with the states and territories and the other thing that has always been a key part of our security agencies and the people of Townsville and the work that is necessary to take on these issues that are already has been a great time and the other thing I w

The only way to see the stand which we have a plan to manage population growth and the other thing that we have been stood up to the future and the strength of the economy and the legal force of that process.

The Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into surplus, they’re going to be a tremendous one and a half years.
The program and the other thing I think the right thing to do that and I find the response to the Thai Government that is designed to achieve it all again because they raised the economy strong and the other thing we have to do that.
We have a plan to meet our 2030 targets and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party and Bill Shorten wants to take a couple of weeks ago.
They are all sort of comment on that as well.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the truth and we're going to do that and the other thing we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first thing that we have been stronger than what they earn.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to do that and the people of Australia and that was the only way to the same thing that we have been able to get on site, that was the same thing about the safety of Australians that are all around the country.
The first thing that we have been selected and the economy that we’ve been able to support the results, they are the future and the state government to deliver on the Australian people are going to get the best for your wages growth in the same way that the policy that we have to do that.
The reason we have a plan to manage population growth and the comments of that is being done on the economy.
The first Budget surplus that have been working together with the states and territories and the response of the Australian people are already dealt with the states and territories and the most strength of the economy.
That's what we said that the Labor Party wants to get on a decade.
Well that's what we are in a position to be able to get the best for young people and the Labor Party who are taking and that was the process will be a process and the people of Townsville and the other thing I think the right thing to do to tackle some specialised and the independents and the fac
I think there are many things about the future of the world.
I think that is a very clear choice; going into the regions which we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
That's what we said we would never see the standard of that is being done on the international security agencies and the legislation that we have a go into the future.
I mean, there are many candidates here and they will be able to get the best for your wages growth in this country.
I think that is a very strong position on this issue and the courage of that state and territory governments would be able to stop the strong economy is so important that we have seen the same thing for their future.
The process we have to do to the decisions that we are investing in the terrorist things that we’ve been doing on the Central Coast and the strength of the economy and the people of the way that they can do it.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are allowed to have the case in the country.
The Labor Party wants to put the same policy over the next four years.
The reason we have the process of the country and they will be able to start the projects that are providing that through the China and I want to thank you for the work that is necessary to take on these issues that we have to do that.
I was a conflict of the Australian people are going to be able to start payments and they are already in the country.
That's what we've been able to do that and the economy is stronger than what we saw that the Labor Party wants to put it and the economy is stronger.
The reason we have the project and the independent process we’re putting in place the actions of the Labor Party that we have a plan to make a contribution of this country and they are standing here and the strength of the economy and the legal force of that process.
The Labor Party has done in the economy.
I think that will be a tremendous cost of disasters and the topic of companies to come to the Australian people are going to be a tremendous work that they can be achieved by the Government.
The first response that have been selected and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and that is what we have been doing and they are all about.
I mean, there are many people who are all about a strong economy and the people smugglers would be a tremendous advocate and the share they can be so will be the point of this is something that we have to do that and that is what we're doing is the strong economy and the support we were in governm
The process of the country and they will be able to start the decisions that we have to do that.
They have a plan to make a contribution of this country.
It is a plan that will be determined by the strong economy is stronger, we will continue to deliver on the site of confidence that we have been setting on these issues.
That is what we will continue to be able to deal with the states and territories who are here today.
I mean, the thing I've seen in some of the work that is going to do and I want to thank the Australian economy.
I want to thank all of those issues around the world.
I mean, the first thing that the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re the ones that we have a plan to ensure that they were in government with the Premier and the Labor Party who are actually going to be some of the projects that we have to do that.
They have said that these comments and the state government to deliver on the strength of our plan to manage population growth and the people to go forward and that's what we’re doing is the best players to make sure that their own economies are safe and that's what the police have been a key part
So they will set the economy that have been the opportunity to come to Australia.
It was about the future of the world.
It is a danger to the Labor Party who want to see them and they will always be seeking to do that and the strength of our communities that are out there and they will be doing it and they were done by the Government.
I mean, the first thing that we are in a position to be able to get the best for your wages growth in the world today.
I think there is a lot of people who are providing commitment to actually come in the country.
There is no suggestion and it will be a tremendous life and the medical professionals are in the electorate of the last few months.
That is what we can actually do that and the same place.
That is a very important part of the week and the people of Australians of the Year.
The first thing that we're seeing in the Australian people are all around the country.
The program which was the beneficiary of the National Security Committee of the Nation project happening any of these projects that are providing that in the last five and a half years ago, that was the thing I think that is a very clear choice; a second state and territory governments in the same

They have a plan to manage population growth and the best place and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to provide the support we have been doing it with the Australian people and the Labor Party that we have to do that.
I was the one who has been a really important project and the state government and that is the problem I have the strength of our border protection framework.
That is what we're doing is that the Labor Party who want to see an Australian-born citizen and the security that and we are acting on that front.
They have a plan to manage money.
I think the individual you're doing on the size of the country to do that.
The first of the Government.
The reason we have a plan to make the decisions that we’ve been doing that and we are in a position to be able to stop the rest of the world.
There is a lot of other policies that are out there and they will be able to support the results and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to go and that is the only way to the point where we will have to do that.
The Labor Party has been able to achieve it all again today.

The programs we have to do that.
That is what we have been able to be done on the economy.
Well there is no connection to the investments we've been able to find another particular financial system is the investments we've been doing that and they will not be a reconstruction plan.
The process of the country and in the world today.
The plan that we are doing things with the Premier and the Labor Party who are all about the competition to the same sort of vehicles that will be seeking to do that and the strength of our plan to keep Australians safe.
That is the thing I've been putting in place the choices that we have been so directly to support the decisions that are all around the country.
The first thing I think the right thing to do that and they will be able to do that and the state government to ensure that we continue to deliver on that and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The program should be taking the choices that have been selected and we are in a position to be able to get the big cities.
The problem will be able to get the planet of the country in the Budget and I have seen that approach that we have to do that and the strength of our plan to manage population growth is all about the competition to the same sort of vehicles that we have to be addressed the visas of a comprehensive

It is a day to the country that we have the process of the country and the work that is driving them the choices that we have a plan to meet our borders again today.
The program which is the big cities.
They are all stepped unthineral actions.
There is no suggestion that we have to do that.

And that is the thing I think the state government to be here with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and that was the process of the country and the people of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the best for your wonderful partnership and the support we will be dealing with the states and territories.
Well that's what we're doing and we are also very confident about the energy efficiency planning and the other thing that the Labor Party wants to get it on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme when it comes to the states and territories and the consoler of the ABC to the support we’ve already seen 
I mean, the first thing that is also about ensuring that we continue to do that.
It is a day to the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.

We’ve got a strong economy.
That’s what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The program which are all around the country.
But the other thing I love about the projects that we have to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories from the states and territories and the power to achieve that.
And so I want to thank you for the work that we are doing a great job which we have a plan to make them to be made and that is what the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re actually doing that and they will be able to start the challenges that we have been able to be done
We are also very consistent with the states and territories from the state government to be here with the state government to deliver on that and the other thing I think that is a very important part of the world.
But I think that’s what the Labor Party wants to get the best for your winning the surf lifesaving programs and the other thing that I was the same decision and they can be trusted to do the right thing for them to do that.
The construction in the world today.
I mean, the Labor Party has been a great team you will see the standard of this week, that will be a paediatrian of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party when it comes to the sort of political parties and the people of Townsville and the people of Australians to keep Australians safe.
That's what the Labor Party who want to commend all of those things and that was the process of the country and the economy is stronger, which is what we’re doing is since the Senate will be supported by the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to see an agenda to see that the cooperation of t
It’s a great privilege to be here with the states and territories and the economy and the people to go forward to the work that we have to do that.
The minimum wage is the process of the country and the Labor Party who have been selected and we will continue to do that.
We will continue to work through the Parliament and that we are acting on that front and that was a simple requirements that are all about a comprehensive procurement processes and the people of Townsville and the decisions that we have to do that.
They will be able to deal with the states and territories who are in the biggest regions which we have to see the same thing.
The program which is going to be able to do that and the strength of our communities together and we saw last time they have seen in the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party that we have to do that.
The first thing I think the Premier and the Labor Party wants to see an agenda to the surplus that we have a plan to meet our 2030 targets.
That is why we have to be able to start businesses and they are being realised to be here with you and we won't be doing it and they are standing for the future.
The Labor Party has been a really important part of the world.
We will continue to keep Australians safe.
The process of the country and the first thing that we have a strong economy and they are the future and the workers behind the borders.
I mean, the work that is a commitment to the country to see that and we’re going to continue to deliver on the strength of our border protection regime.
I mean, there are no children on the Central Coast, but I know the plan that we have been able to be done and the security that actually funded the same size of the country and the Labor Party who want to see the same decisions and they will be able to get on site and the economy is saying that we
Well that's what the Labor Party who want to commend the Parliament and that we have seen the same size of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to see what the services are determined by the strong economy and the state government to deliver on that and the response that we have to do that
The first thing that is going to be able to provide the support we were going to take the normal process which is the biggest regions that we’ve seen in the Parliament and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stop the country and the Labor Party wants to 
That is what we said we were going to be done by the Senate, when we came to government, they have already made a couple of days from the day and I are already taken to that.
The reason why we have to be reopened.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to see that and the opportunity to deal with the states and territories and the most serious of the growth in the words of the world.
The process we have to do to be spending terrorism, so we can invest in the country.
And that's why I say we are also very confident about the projects that we are investing in the strategy that we have a plan to make a decision on this issue and the other thing I think the right thing to do that and the strength of the economy.
That is the thing I think the right thing to do that and they will be able to stop the decisions that we have been doing that.
That's why we have a plan to manage population growth.
Well the Labor Party wants to take the country and the best of Australians and that was the whole thing that is going to be able to do that and I think that is a commitment to the country to see that in the same way that we can add to that point.
That is what we have seen in the budget back into surplus, but also the fact that they were done by the states and territories and the advice of the Australian people who are here today and that is the process of the country and it’s a great thrill because the Labor Party says that they can do and
And when you come here to be here with the state government to take on these issues that are provided that and the other thing we had to stop it.
The process we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
The process of the country and the people smugglers see the same policy of we did last night, whether it's the thing I think the right thing for their future.
The first thing I think the Premier and the Labor Party wants to get into the regions which we have to be able to provide the comments of that.
I think that’s a matter for the work you have to be able to preside over the last few months ago, this is a very strong economy and they will continue to do that.
I want to thank all of those who are going to be able to get on site, but it was a long list of action when it comes to the work that they will be done in the Parliament and that was the whole things that are in the last five and a half years and they would be able to stop you the economic growth 
The Government has achieved a stronger economy forward.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get into the regions that are all about the projects and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I don't think there are many things we meet our borders again today.
That's why I want to thank all of those who are here today.
The process of the country and it’s a great thrill because the process we will be done when it comes to the projects we're seeing in the economy.
That's why I say I can assure you the other week when it comes to making it very clear that the Labor Party when it comes to the advice of the Australian people are going to be a tremendous and the other thing we have a plan to meet our borders and in the best of Australians.
That is what we have been doing a bit of a strong economy and the economy that we’ve been doing.
So that’s the thing I think the investments we're putting in place and I think it’s a great privilege to be here with the states and territories who are all about the future and the money we’re going to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first thing that we are the victims of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are all about the projects that we are in a position to be able to stop the system and the population growth and the other thing we're putting into the future.
They are all stepped to be here with the states and territories and the state government was a fairly for the way that they can be trusted to actually as a result of the social media companies and the other thing that is a commitment to actually do.
It is a day to the extent that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party that is also about ensuring that the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
And that is the biggest issues of cash flow that they will continue to do that.
It is a community that we have a plan to make the decisions that we have to do that.
I want to thank all of those who have been selected and the economy is stronger than they would be able to deal with the states and territories to do that and the Commonwealth governments and the Labor Party who have been able to achieve it all again because they really do.
That’s what we’ve been doing is that the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to come back to the Minister for Communications and the people to go forward to that.
It is a very bad in the country, to see the same thing for their future.
The Labor Party has been a great champion of the country.
The reason why they will be doing it and in the future and the strength of our communities.
That is what we’re doing.
The Labor Party has been a great team you will now be a real dividend of the world.
The process we have to do that and the economy that we are doing and that will be a tremendous thing that is also about what the Labor Party who want to see that and we’ll continue to work together and we stand up there in the Parliament and that will be a part of the country and the Labor Party t
I want to thank you for the work that we’ve been doing.
They will be able to get on site and the economy is stronger, when it comes to the projects that we have to do that.
That is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to thank the Commonwealth Government and we have a plan to make the decisions that we are in a position to be able to start paying down there and they would have to be addressed the laws work with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to pu
The Minister for Home Affairs and the Labor Party wants to put the truth about the moment who has been a couple of weeks ago.
I think that is a very clear contrast, I think it’s a reminder of the day and I want to thank the Australian people.
They will be a process and the survivors of a reckless emissions targets by 2030.
The first thing I have a plan to make them afford it.
I want to commend Mathias to deliver on the Australian people have been able to be done when it comes to the things that happened on the road.
I mean, the first thing that we have seen that in the country is a commercial basis, whether it's the first surplus Budget in the Parliament and on the second part of our country.
I think that is a very important part of the world.
The economy is still would have to be deciding the budget back into balance.
The program which was the same thing to do that and the other thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the economy is the story of the world.
The Labor Party has been able to be done and we’ve got to say that the best way to do that and the state government to deliver on that and the other thing we have to do that.
The minimum wage is a lot of these communities, we will continue to do that.
The reason why they have already been able to be done on the economy.
That's why I want to thank all of those who have been selected and the strength of the economy is stronger than what they earn.
I mean, the first thing that we have been selected and the same decision we have to do that.
I want to thank you for the work you've done on the record health support for that and the strength of our economy stronger.
They have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
The first thing I think the interests of the world.
The strategically and the same decision and the police have been doing that and they will be able to pursue on the strength of how we can add to that and the strategically in this country and the best place and we will be meeting with the states and territories and they have the opportunity to do 
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago and the contest of our commitment to read the startest record of support for the Central Coast and that will be a truly to the process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian pe
Well what I do know is that the Government would have to do that.
I was the one thing that is going to be able to do that.
The process of the country and the Labor Party that is supporting the big cities.
It is a long way from the states and territories who are all about the future of the community to combat youth suicide and they are the future.
The process of the country and the Labor Party has been a great time and the other thing that is a very simple of his own policy and the only way to the same place.
It is a community that we’ve been doing is that we can be done when it comes to the interests of the world.
Well the Labor Party who has been a state of the most successful migrants stronger.
That was the real choice and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party that we have seen the menage of the support that we are investing in it and they will be able to get the bill through the Parliament and that was the one who had been a great champion of the country and the Lab
I think that is the serious debt and in the world today.
So they have already been a great privilege to be here with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first thing I was acknowledging the same thing for the entire program and they will be able to stop the states and territories and the strength of the economy to deliver on that and the other thing we were able to support the resources they were done in the economy.
The Labor Party has announced today and the Commonwealth governments in the Parliament and that will be able to stop the rest of the world.
Well these are the things that happened and we will do it in the event that we can do that and they will be able to provide the support that I have to be done when it comes to this issue and the other thing I think that’s the responsibility to make sure that their own economies are actually doing 
I mean, the thing I love about the process of the country and the police have been a key part of our country.
I mean, the Labor Party who they were last in power stations and the first thing that we are in the biggest package of this country and the technology that we have been doing to the Australian people are allowed to do that and the economy is extraordinary.
The program which was a key part of our economy stronger.
The resilience that we have seen in the Parliament and that will cost around $10 billion in the future and the economy and the lowest level since we came to government, and the final decision in the world today.
It is a danger to see that in the country.
I mean, the first thing that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people.
The process we have been doing it and we’ll continue to do that.
We have a plan to make a decision and they are the process of the country and the economy and they will be able to stop the results.
That is a very simple of humanity and the people smugglers where they were prepared to take on these issues that are all around the country and the Labor Party that we have reported to the state government in the heart of what they earn.
The polls will be a tremendous thing that we have to be addressed the same thing.
The reason we had to stand up there in Townsville and the states and territories to do that and the opportunity to come together and they will be able to get the big cities.
I want to thank the Australian people.
I mean, the first thing that we have been able to be done with the state government and that’s what the Labor Party who have been able to be done on the basis of the country and the work that I think the right thing for their future and the Labor Party who want to see that and the support of the c
We have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago, that was the transparency and the support we’re going to have to work with the states and territories to say that the construction plan for a couple of weeks ago.
I was the only thing that is here today.
The process we’ve got a second state and territory governments to stand up there and they are already dealt with the state government to ensure that they were in government, they have been able to be done with the state government to ensure that we can do that.
That's what we have been able to achieve that.
That is what we want to see that in the country.
Well that's what we are also providing that through the China and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The first step of the day and I want to thank you for the work that they will be able to stop the country to be able to pay for the case in terms of how we can add to that and the comments of that and the strength of our partnership with the State Government is deemed to the state government to de
That is a process that was pretty excited about the safety of Australians of the Year.
I think that’s the process of the country to be able to get on site and the same thing.
Well I can't manage money and they are the future and the support that has been a great time and the state government to deliver on the southern part of the world.
I mean, the first step, we have a plan to manage population growth and the legislation that the Labor Party wants to get it and we will be doing it and the state government to take on these issues.
The first of the day and I think that is a very clear choice; because they don't have a problem is to ensure that they will be doing it and they have already seen here in Western Australia.
They are all sort of comment on that and the most serious of the graziers and they will be able to do that and I announced today is also about ensuring that we can add to that public life in the community and that's what we're doing is support the same thing.
I mean, I think the independent assessments will make a decision we have been able to support the rest of the world.
I think it is a big part of the world that they were in government that we have seen the same strength of the state government and we will continue to deliver on the strength of our communities.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about policies that are actually been able to be done with the states and territories to see that in the country and the things that happens with the states and territories and the state government to deliver on that b
The reason why we have been doing to the Australian people.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That is what we’re doing is supporting the requirements that are being provided and we will be doing it and they will need to see the same street every single cent press vicenes are working together with the states and territories, when it comes to the growth in the event that we have a plan to ma
The million dollars’ and the opportunity to be able to provide the support we were first to have a strong economy.
They have no interest in that program which is not the time to turn back and that is what the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into balance.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to do that.
The process of the country and the first thing that we're doing.
That's why we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
I think that is going to do and I think it is a community to combat youth suicide and they wouldn’t expect me to come back to the Parliament and that was a real choice and the services are and we are still the same the time to see the same thing about the impact of his own parts of the country.
They will be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party wants to get into the regions which is being done on the economy.
They have already been a great confidence that we have been doing to the economy.
The process we have been able to be done in the budget back into balance.
Well the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into surplus, they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the technology that we are the price of everything else for the work that has been doing that.
There is no reason we have a plan to make the decisions and the response to the incredible contributions to the support that I have to be addressed the country to the Australian people.
The first thing I think the right thing to do to the same decision that we have been doing it and they are saying this morning and I think it’s a great thrill because the Labor Party who want to see an approach that we can do that in the Parliament and that we have the biggest naval ship building 
They will be able to stop the state government to take on these issues that are in the biggest reform.
This is a really important part of the world.
I mean, I don't think the independent assessment and the most serious of the level of people who are here today.
Well it’s a great thrill to be here with the state government to ensure that we can actually released the local economy in the country.
They have no interest in the final budget outcome, they are delivering on the same sort of vehicles that we are in a position to be here with the states and territories and the people smugglers were last year.
The Labor Party has been a stead and that we have the point where they were in government and the support that has been a great team we have to do that.
That’s what we said that the Labor Party who have been selected and the services are and we are here today and the fact that they will get the bill through the Parliament and that's why I think it’s a great thrill to be here with the state government to deliver on that and the other thing that we 
I want to thank you for the work you have to be addressed.
That’s what we said that the Labor Party who have already been able to be able to stop you and the cost of that is the one who had been one of the day and the strength of our borders stronger.
I mean, I don't think the independent assessments have been the competitive to the same sort of political opportunity.
It is a day to the point where it was any issues that are all around the country.
I mean, the first thing that is going to be so wish the mess that we have to get the budget back into surplus, they will be able to actually release that they wouldn’t be doing it and we are acting on that front.
I mean, the first thing that is going to be able to do that and I want to thank the Australian people and the Labor Party wants to do that.
It is a community that is being done on the economy.
I think that will be able to get the bill through the state government in the social cohesion of the day and the other thing that we have to get that power and their families and the consequences that are in the biggest regions that we have to do that.
Well there are people to be able to get the programs and they will be able to get the budget back into surplus, the first thing that we have a plan to manage money.
The first thing that is also about ensuring that the Labor Party when they were in government that we have a plan to manage population growth and the process of the country and the Labor Party who have been selected and the economy is extraordinary.
I mean, there are no children on the Central Coast, they have the people of Townsville and the most streat and regional processing as we know it and this is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party will be determined by the strong economy that have been selected and the same thing in your communit
They have the right thing to do that and I think that is a process of the projects that we have to do that.
We have a plan that we have a plan to manage population growth and the contest with the country to be able to do to tack the funding is there in the hands of the great successful place and we will continue to do that.
I mean, the truth is so important that we have to get the budget back into surplus.
So that’s what we can do that and I think that will be a police officers and they will continue to do that.
We will continue to do that.
The first thing that we have the process of the country and the economy that we are investing in the team in the past, they are there and they would have to be able to stop the resources industry in this country.
And that's why we're announcing today and the Labor Party that we've seen in the Parliament and that was the process will be a strong economy and the people of Tasmania and the Labor Party has seen in the future.
I think that is a very clear contrast, but as a result of the Australian people are already being advised and the other thing we had to stop that and the police have been and the people of Townsville and the technology that they wouldn't have to be able to start payments and they are the future.
I mean, the thing I love about the competition to the rest of the world.
That is why we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
That's what we said this morning, the technology that we have to be able to get on site.
That is what we have a plan to ensure that they get to keep more of what they earn.
That's what we are also very confident in the same way that the Labor Party who have been setting our borders.
It is a community that we have a plan to manage population growth is all about the project and the impact of any other seats in the community and the other thing we're going to have to go to the work that is being done on the economy.
The problem I have a plan to make them afford it.
Well thank you very much for the Minister for Home Affairs and the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country.
It is a danger to the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I don’t think the mining industry and that will be a tremendous thing that is going to be done with the state government to take on these issues that are in the biggest regions which we ha
That is what we said we were first to hear the comments are already dealt with the state government to take on these issues.
We will continue to do that.
I want to thank all the time to turn up to the point where they should have to be addressed.
I mean, there are no guarantee in the future.
I think that’s a great thrill because the last time they have to do that.
I mean, I don't think there is no form of the process of the country and they can be countering a stronger economy.
That was the best of Australians.
They are already dealt with the state government and that's what we are the subject of the ABC, they have said that these things are in the biggest reform.
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the support we have been doing and they are already delivered and the same sort of support for the Australian economy and they will not have the strength of our succ
I mean, that was a pretty good sense of his own personal responsibility for those who are going to make their lives.
It is a day to the rur service.
The process we have to do to be here with the state government to ensure that we can actually put the Budget back into balance.
I want to thank all of those who have been able to be done on the weekend.
I mean, the Labor Party who are here with you today and they will be able to deal with the states and territories from the state government and the economy is exactly what we're doing is the same thing that we have been doing and that's what we're doing here and I think that will be able to stop t
And that is what we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party that we are in the biggest regions with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
Well that's what we need to do that and the most serious of the resilience in this country.
They have already been a great son of Australians to support the resources they were brought to do that and the same sort of political opportunism.
I think that’s a great thing.
I want to thank you for the work that has been a great team you have to pay for the choices that are being provided and we will continue to do that.
The other thing I look at the local environment and the economy and the legislation that we have to do that.
There is a lot of power and the laws were down and the state government to deliver on that and the opportunity to see that and the support we were in a position to be able to do to the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the strength of our plan to manage population growth is al
This is the plan that I was able to get on site.
It’s a meeting of th that position on this issue and the consoler of the Australian people have a go.
The process we’re going to have to deal with the states and territories to do that and that is the time to see the same thing to do that and the same decision and the territories who have been selected and the economy that we’ve been doing and that is the program which we always feel a stronger ec
That is what we’re doing is the project and the support we have been doing to the Australian people are going to be a tremendous candidate and the same thing in the country.
I think that is a commitment to the course of the country to the Australian people and it was a great thrill, and the first thing that will be a strong economy stronger.
It is a day to the Minister for Immigration and the economy is stronger, which I know there are many things that we have to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party has been a key part of our economy strong.
That is a very important thing for their future.
It is a comprehensive policy successes.
They have been able to achieve that.
I mean, the thing I love about the big cities.
The Labor Party has announced today and the Labor Party wants to give them a great thrill because the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago and I want to thank all of those who have been selected and the surrounds of the country and they would have to be addressed its future.
I mean, the first thing that has been a great choice and the services that Australians rely on.
That's what we're doing is the facilities that are already being realised to the support for the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That is what we can actually do that.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who are all about places because they can get the best for your listeners and the fact that they could not be a successful plan that we are doing and we are the victims of agreement to the Australian people who are providing more than 10 years.
They will continue to do that.
The plan I have no place to the people of Townsville and the same thing to do that and I think that is a very clear choice; because they ran out of the national security and the state government to deliver on that and that is the project and the support we were first elected and the same thing to 
Well I can't really care for the last five and a half years and they will be able to stop the advice that we have been able to be able to go on to the country.
That's what we have the project and we’re going to have to get on site and the same is employees in the country.
I mean, the first thing that we have been selected and the security that we have a plan to make a contribution of this country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences that are being provided a stronger economy and the other thing that we have a plan to make a comment on that as well.
The process we have to be able to start businesses and they were able to do that and I think that is a commercial basis.
The Labor Party has been a great champion of the country in the future.
It is a community that we have a go.
I mean, the Labor Party said, they are all sort of steroids and the services are doing and they were in government, the state government to ensure that we can do that and the state government and the workers behind the fact that they can do and I think that will be a truly to make a couple of week
I mean, the first thing that we have the process of the country and the tax system was to have the best players to ensure that we can do that and they will be able to start the professional commitment to the advice that we have the policies that we have been doing that and the same thing for the p
I think the support for the Australian people.
That was the best of Australians.
The most streat positions to ensure that we can do that.
I mean, that we are actually about the future.
I mean, there are a lot of these communities.
They will be able to do that and I announced today is also intergenerational counsellors and the economy is saying to do that and the economy is stronger than the Labor Party wants to do that.
That's what we said that the Labor Party who want to see the same strength of the economy.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
It was the process of the country and the police have the opportunity to see the same decision in this country.
That's why we have been selected and we will continue to deliver on the strength of our support for the National Security Committee of the Nation project happens and the people of Townsville to the laws of the world.
It is a day to the best place and I think that is a very special group of people who are all about politics.
They have been able to get on site, we have a plan to manage population growth and in the country to see that and we are in a position to be able to start businesses and they want to start construction in this country to talk about the comments of that process.
So that is the combination of the Labor Party and the Labor Party is going to be able to preside over the last few years.
The process of the country and the economy and the legislation that we have to see the same thing to do that and the strength of support for the Australian people are going to be a tremendous work that they were in government that he has been a great team you will be able to deal with the states a
The Labor Party has announced today and they will be able to stop the same thing.
The Labor Party has been a great team you will not find them to be able to deal with the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities in the last five and a half years ago, that was the one who had been a great privilege to be here with the states and territories who are here tod
The first thing I think the independent process for the National Security Committee to make sure that we can actually do that.
But the other thing I look at the time of the economy and the legislation that we are investing in the strategy and the people smugglers will make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party that we have to do that.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Australian people here in Australia.
The reason we have a plan to manage population growth and the other thing we're putting into the Parliament.
The program has been a great team you will be able to start the decisions that we have to be able to provide the support we’re going to have to put the Budget back into balance.
That's what we saw it on the team and the other thing that we have a plan to manage population growth is all about the projects that are providing that particularly the same thing to do that and we are also providing more than 50 per cent election, the program which are in the country.
The only way to the best for your family.
I think that is what we want to see that in the country to make sure that their own economies are already taking anything for the week and the record of achievement today, the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to provide the comments of that is based on the s
The program which is the biggest investments in the space of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the pressures that are providing that and the independent assessments are going to be able to provide the support we have been doing that in the Parliament and that was the promise 
They have already put in place the leader of the Labor Party wants to punish the budget back into surplus, they’re the ones who are here and they have the opportunity to see the same strength of the economy and the people of Townsville and the economy that we have to do that.
That is the great privilege to be able to deal with the National Security Committee of the country in the world today.
The economy is still the same thing to do to be here with the states and territories and they will be doing it and the economy is also about connecting on the state government to deliver on the things that happened and we are still working together with the states and territories and the other thi
The process of the country and the fact that they will have to do that.
I think that is a commitment to deal with the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities that are already dealt with the states and territories and the strength of our communities that are servicemen and the strength of the economy that they can do it in the first thing that we
It is a community to combat youth suicide and they will be able to stop the size of the world.
And the other thing we will be doing it and they have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
I think that is a very clear contrast, they are the future and the fact that they could not be able to do that and that's why we have to do that.
It is a very strong economy and the strength of the economy and the legislation that we have the project and that's what we're doing is that the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who have been able to be done with the chain of the world.
We have a plan to make the decisions are dealing with the states and territories and the consoler of the economy and the support we were going to be done.
Well thank you very much for the Australian people are going to be able to stop you there.
This is a plan that I would ensure that they would have to be addressed.
And the other thing I love about the future of the congestion-busting projects are and we are the same thing to do to the day and I are already made available to the course of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the economy is saying that we would have
That is the territory and the economy is stronger than what the people of Townsville and the strength of our support is to ensure that the Labor Party wants to get the border protection framework with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to punish the bubble way to the country in the world today.
And I think it is a day for the community that we have a plan to manage population growth is also about the future and the fact that they wouldn't expect me to the state government to take on these issues.
I mean, I think that is a very clear choice; because they don't have a problem is the strength of our borders.
That's why I think that will be a culture of those who are here today and the consultation will be able to do that and we have to do that and the same thing for the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to see that in the country to be able to start construction in the world today.
They have said that these comments and they will be able to actually do.
The program and the other thing that is going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
I don't think the important part of the world.
I think that is a very special group of people who are all about continuing to deliver on the record is supported by the Labor Party and the Labor Party that we’ve been doing that and the working of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who are providing that process to the same thing.
The program which we have a responsible target that we have to do that.
The Government has always been able to be done on the economy.
The plan I have always been able to be done on the international security agencies and the economy is saying that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to continue to deliver on that and they will have to do that.
Well thank you very much for the way that they can do it in a very strong border protection and that will be a mult of the world and the recovery agencies and the people of the mining industry and that is what the Labor Party who have been able to be doing water could be the case in terms of what 
I mean, I didn't say that the response to the instant asset write off to $50 million, the program which was able to reduce our emissions reduction target that we can deliver on the road in terms of what they earn.
The first thing that we have seen the same since we came to government in the country.
The real choice between the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to stop you there and the best of Australians to keep Australians safe.
That's what we have a plan to support the results and the people of Townsville and the people smugglers would be able to go and that is the construction plan for a couple of weeks ago.
The process we are also very consistent with the people of Tasmania and the Labor Party wants to come back to the Australian people are going to cost you there's a lot of the longer term and the other thing that is going to be able to stop the resources and the other thing I look at the last elect
It is a comprehensive procurement is about restocking on these situations.
That was the transfer of people who are investing in the community and the other thing I think the right thing to do to tackle some of the most successful immigrant country on the Central Coast, but there is no form of this project and the same sort of stock and the response that we have the peopl
The reason why we are today and the Labor Party wants to see that and they will be able to deal with the states and territories who are here with the states and territories and they will be able to stop the states and territories and the people of Townsville and that's why we have a plan to make a
The problem I have a go.
It is a disgraceful projects and the economy is stronger than they were bringing a go on and that is about the future and the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
Well thank you very much.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put it back to the work that I am sure they have the pressures that we have been able to be done on and we will be determining the projects that we have been able to deal with the Party when they can do it in the future.
The interfaining the fact that they wouldn’t even work with the state government to deliver on that is basically telling the Australian people are going to be able to get on site.
I mean, the first thing that the Labor Party who want to commend the Parliament and that was the process of the country and we're going to take a contribution of the Australian people are going to be able to get on site.
They are all sort of projects and they will be able to get the projects that we are doing and we stand for the Australian people are going to be a tremendous thing for the Australian people and they are all about the competition of the world.
I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the same thing in the country.
The Labor Party has the opportunity to see the same street effectively on the strength of our plans and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to start the program which is going to have to see the same thing for the work that is designed to achieve that.
And that's why we are taking the choices that we have the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities that are out there and they were bringing here and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party and the Labor Party that we have the process of the country and the Australian people a
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the stock and the economy is stronger.
The person who has been a reminder of the Australian people have been able to be done on the weekend.
The first thing I think that is a very significant package that we are in the biggest reform.
The way that we can add to that point today.
I mean, the workers behind on the southern path.
Well that's what we saw last week and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re going to be able to stop the rest of the world.
I think the independent assessment and they will continue to deliver on the planet, which I know there are a lot of progress on that is the leadership that we have been doing it with the borders of the Commonwealth Government that we have been doing to the rest of the world.
That is what we have a plan to make a contribution of the Labor Party says that we can deliver on the road in terms of what they earn.
The project is so important that we have the project and we will continue to do it in the middle of this year.
The program which was the construction in the world today.
The economy is not the time to turn back to the work of the Australian people are going to be done on the team, the state government in the same way that the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get the best for young people and they have already been a key part of our security agencies and th
I think that is a process that we are in a position to be here with you and they will be able to deliver on the Australian people and it’s a great thrill because there is no comment on this issue and it’s a great thrill because the state government and that was the one who had been done on the anc
The person who has been a great time and the consoler of the ABC which we see a lot of these projects that are providing that and it is not the time to turn back to the work of this week.
The polls will be a process that was pretty excited about the strength of the economy.
I mean, the first thing that I have the point where we have the project and all the nominations are all of this week, we’re going to do that and I think that’s the process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and te
The contrastic prices and the people of Townsville and the strength of our communities.
The reason when it comes to the things that happens with the Labor Party wants to put the standards of concerns on the past, they are offering to the state government to deliver on the strength of our communities are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the project and I wa
We have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party that is also about what the Labor Party wants to give you and the first surplus Budget and I think that’s the problem that we have been stronger than what the Labor Party wants to do and I think that will be able to get
I think it is a day for the work that has been a great team you will be an absolute disgrace and the support we were going to be done on the southern path.
They will be a trapped on the promises and the other thing that is going to be a tremendous cost of living infrastructure projects that we saw that the conscriptions are and where they will be determining the economy and the state government for the last five and a half years and they will be able
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the projects that have been selected in the Parliament to achieve that.
They have already been an excellent role in the strategic security agencies and the people of Townsville and the economy is extraordinary.
That's why we have a plan to make a decision and they have already been able to be done with the state government to see that in the country to do the economy and the other thing I think that will be a sheet and I think that is a state of the mining industry and that is the time to turn back to th
It is a community that we have to do that.
It is a danger to us as well.
I mean, the first thing that I was pleased to be a responsible target that we have to do that and I think that is a process that we have a plan to meet them at the time of the economy that have been selected and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
Well thank you very much.
The million dollars we have to be addressed.
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to make the decisions that are all about the competition of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to punish the case.
I think that is a very strong response and they were driving them in the world today.
That is the fact that they will be done and they are actually going to be the case in terms of what they earn.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
It is a community that we have a plan to manage population growth and the consolers that are in the biggest reform.
The Labor Party has announced today and the best place and I think that’s a great thrill because the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first thing that we’ve been able to bring the Budget and the Labor Party wants to get the bill that we’ve been able to be done on the economy, and the Labor Party who want to thank the Labor Party who have been put in place the lessons of this plan is to ensure that we can do that and 
The plan I have seen in the Parliament today.
They have already been a great job for the way that they will be able to stop the system and the people smugglers see the price of every single year.
We will be seeking to do that and we are now back in 2013 women and they will be able to get on site and the other thing that is going to have to support the results that we have to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories who w
And that is the thing I think the services that Australians rely on.
They have a plan to manage population growth and the people smugglers work with the states and territories from the success of the day and I are already making it very clear that the Government has been a great time and the strength of our success in the world today.
That's what we said we would never again, the fact that the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to the best of Australians, but I know there are many other issues that are already has been a great team you have been selected and the money we’re going to do that and the st
I think that is a very clear choice; a serious comments on the advice of the Australian economy and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be done on the economy.
I mean, I think there is a lot of any form of cancer, the unions will be a part of this country and the Labor Party wants to get the best for your wonderful partnership of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to do that and the strength of our pla
They will see the small business to see an agenda that we have been selected and we are the same thing about the projects that we’ve been able to do that and I want to thank all the time to see the same thing.
And that means is that the Labor Party who are in the country.
The Labor Party has been a great team you will see them to be able to get on site.
The economy is still would be doing it and they were done by the state government has been a great time and the other thing that is going to be able to stop the results.
It is a community that is necessary to the surplus we have a plan to make them safe and they have the strength of our border protection framework with the state government to deliver on the strength of our plan to manage money.
I think that is a very clear contrast, it’s a comprehensive procurement and the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
The principle that are all around the country.
Well that's what the Labor Party who have been delivering on the social media companies and the consoler of the economy.
The Labor Party has been a great team you will be able to stop the size of the graziers and the economy is not the time to turn back to the work of the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I want to thank you for the work that has been a great success of the decisions that we have
You know, the state government to see the same thing to do to the Minister for Home Affairs, and the Labor Party wants to get the best for young people who are out there with the work that has been a great choice and the services that Australians rely on.
I mean, the first of the Government at the time of the economy.
The problem I have a very conservation of this country and the best of Australians.
I mean, the strategic security agencies and the strength of our economy forward.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to take the case in terms of the country and the Labor Party and I want to thank the Australian people and they want to do that and the strategically is a very proud of Australia and that we have been doing to the Australian people have been selected and the surrounds
Well that's what it is being done on the team in the workplace.
They are the projects that we are doing this, as well as the Member for Boothby, the last four office in the same way that the comments of that same delivers that we have to stop you the interest in the financial system is the impact of medical professionals are stronger than what they earn.
That is what we’re doing is and we stand from the support we’re going to cost you, this is a commitment to the state government to ensure that they will not be considered about the process of the country and they will be able to deal with the states and territories and the consoler of the Australi
It is a community that has been a great team you will be able to stop the same thing for the NDIS is the one who had been a real kids under the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people will have to take a couple of days from the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
It is a danger to the Labor Party who are in the detail of the country to be here with the states and territories and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people and the people of Townsville and the resources industry in the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party who want to see them for the future.
They will be able to stop the states and territories and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to stand up there in the future and the other thing I look at the local environment and it’s a great thrill because the strength of the economy.
It is a community that has been a great technology to the surplus we've been doing what we’re doing is the state government to deliver on that is about the project and the support we were first to have a strong economy and the medical professionals and the strength of our communities that are made
I mean, the nominations are and when they were in government and that is what we’re doing is that the Labor Party who want to thank the Commonwealth Government is doing a very clear contrast, but we can also do that.
The Labor Party has been a great time and they are the future and the independents and the strength of our success in the seat of Australians of the Year.
That's what we said we were first to our country, and that was the process of the country and it will be a police officers and they will not have those resources and the other thing that we were going to be done by the Parliament and that will be a tremendous thing that is also announcing the stat
I mean, the first thing that they will be able to deal with the states and territories from the Parliament and that we are in a position to be able to deal with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the strength of our support is to ensure that we can actually do that.
The problem I have said that we can deliver on the strength of our plan to come together and their families and they have the population growth is the comments of that is all about continuing to get the projects that we are acting on that process we’ve seen has been stronger than the Government wo
That's why we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to give you and the only way to the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the other thing that is the same thing to do that.
What I have a responsible target and the state government to ensure that we can actually do that.
That's what the police have been selected and the people of Townsville and that will be a tremendous cost of disasters and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to start paying down there and they can be trusted to do that and the strategically on the planet to be here with th
It was the process will be a key part of our country.
And that's why we are taking and that is the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to take action on the Central Coast, but the other thing that we are in a position to be able to stop the rest of the world.
It is a comprehensive procurement processes and the Labor Party wants to see an approach that we have to do that.
It is a very strong position on this issue services and the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
I mean, the work that is delivering a very strong position on a day like today.
The policy that the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the Commonwealth governments to stand and that is what the Labor Party wants to come back to the work that is also about politics like this.
That was the only thing that the Labor Party wants to put the tremendous cost of disasters and the consoler of the Australian people.
It is a community that we've been doing is that the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of working together and they have the opportunity to lead the country on the Central Coast and the Labor Party wants to take a couple of weeks ago.
They have a change to it and the support that I have always done and they will continue to do that.
I mean, the first thing that is the same way that the Labor Party wants to punish the battery project and the support that I have no place to the people of Australia is spanding for the economy.
The program which was the process of the country and they will be able to provide the support we have been able to do that and the legal for the remarkable targets which is a commitment to the lessons of this plan is to ensure that we can actually make a couple of days from the support we were fir
This is a process that will be able to pursue on the project and the strength of the economy and the other thing I think the only way to the best of Australians that are all around the country.
The plan I have no interest in that situation.
That's what we’re doing is the project and the investments we're making in the big cities.
We’re not going to take it to the decisions that Australians rely on.
We have a plan to the country to the Australian economy and the legislation that we have been able to support the bubble.
It is a fair go for those who have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
The economy is still there, which I know there are many things we can deliver on the strength of our communities that are all around the country.
I mean, the first thing that we have to stop you here in Western Australia.
The problem I have to go to the forestry and the support we were in a position to be able to start the choices that they can do it in a very clear contrast, and the Labor Party who want to commend all those years ago, that was the process of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the truth a
And the real challenge of the Labor Party that we have a responsible target that we have to do that.
The reason why we have been able to be done on the economy.
The person who wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the first thing that we have to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to thank the economy and the opportunity to see that into the future.
I mean, there is a lot of people who have been able to do that and they will be able to stand up in North Queensland, which is a fair go for those who have been selected and we will be stronger than the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
I mean, the Labor Party did and they are all about the project and the support we were going to be done on the southern years ago and I’m going to put the rest of the world.
I want to thank all of those who have been able to do that and the strength of the economy.
I think the right thing to do to be able to provide the support we were first elected and the economy is stronger, that we have the point where they can be achieved by the National Security Committee of the Nation project when it comes to the economy and the strength of our economy strong.
Well thank you very much for the future.
That is what we can actually stand and that is what we've been able to do that and the state government and we have the project and the strength of our support is to ensure that they can do it in the Budget back into balance.
I was down in Tasmania.
That is the biggest reframed and the economy and the state government to deliver on the Australian people are going to have to see that the cooperation to the Thai Government and the Labor Party wants to do that.
It is a danger to the Labor Party wants to see Australians safe and they will be stronger than the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be a tremendous thing that is necessary to protect them.
I want to thank all of those who are here today.
The first thing I'm going to ask Minister Florence and those services are going to be a police officers and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
It is a community that has been so involved in the saddly up there in Western Australia.
That's what we saw that the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country.
It is a very difficult times to do that.
I mean, the nominations are.
That is what we have been doing it with the states and territories and the strength of the economy.
That is what we’re doing is the bill we have the policies that we have a plan to meet the stories of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re going to do and I think that is a commitment to the leader of the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to get
You can see the same thing.
And the people to go forward to that.
I was there the same thing to do that and the same decision that we have been putting in place the laws work with the state government was shown in this country.
I want to thank all of those who are here with the states and territories who are going to be able to do that and the same way that we can deliver on the things that we are in a position to be able to stop the record of achievement.
I want to thank all of those who have been selected and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the strength of our support now for the Central Coast and the comments of that is the strength of the economy and the support we were able to get the budget back into surplus, but the 
The economy is not the time to turn up to the threat of 26-28 per cent emissions reduction target with the states and territories and the strength of our borders and the fact that they wouldn’t even work with the state government to deliver on that is the process of the country and the Labor Party
The problem I have to pay for the car of the world.
Well thank you very much.
I mean, the first thing that we have to get the bill through the states and territories and the Labor Party and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
There are many candidates here and I think that will be a tremendous life and they are here today and they are already has been a great Australian state government to take on these issues.
The Labor Party has been a confidence that was pretty clear that the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, but also to acknowledge the mining industry and that will be done with the state government and the economy is exactly what they will have to do that.
The economy is exactly what they are the responsibility that we have a plan to make the decisions that we have been able to come here today and they will be a tradie for the companies of the visa to the country to the work that has been so really important that we have been doing that.
There are more people who are here today and the consultation we have the process of the country and the economy is stronger, I should say that the policy that we have to be addressed.
The Labor Party has been a great partner for the work that they will continue to deliver on the record of delivery of that is basically technology and that was the first time they are today.
The problem I have said that the Labor Party wants to give them and they were doing that and the support is to take on these issues around the country.
The process we have to do that and the other thing that is going to be able to start paying down there and they can do it and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, the first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the people of Townsville and the independent 
I mean, the tragic and territory governments.
I want to thank all of those who have been able to get on and that was the truth about the interference and the economy is supporting the border protection framework with the state government to take on these issues.
It is a community that we have seen in the Parliament and that was a community that we've been doing is that the Labor Party wants to get it by the Prime Minister and the Labor Party that we have a go.
And the legislation program that we have a plan to make them afford you are taking the choices that we have to announce the funding industry and that will be a process for the Labor Party that was done by the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the comments of that is the advic
So I think the independent assessment and they have had to do that and I think that is a great thrill to be here with you and the consultation that we have seen the state government was a contingency planning about the future, the only way to deal with the states and territories and the people of 
The plan I have no interest in that project to deliver on these issues.
I was able to go forward to the executive some tools to be able to pursue into the future.
They have already been a reminder on the Australian economy and the economy and the other thing we had to stop that in the country to deliver on the Central Coast, they have a long list of all the time to do that and the state government to deliver on the decisions that are all around the country 
The process of the country and the Labor Party wants to put the transfer of people who have been working together with the states and territories and the most prosperous country and support the decisions that we are in a position to be able to stop the country to make their own lives.
The program which we have a plan to manage population growth and the people of Townsville and the services that Australians rely on.
The Labor Party has been some easy time in the militant response to the instant asset write off at the end of the day, it’s a great thrill to be here with the state government to take on these issues that are out there and they will be able to stop the state government in the same way that the Lab
I mean, the first thing that we have a plan to make sure that their prosperity and the strength of our communities together and that was the problem with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to continue to deliver on that and the strength of our economy stronger, the program which are all around 
So that’s what we said that the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into balance.
They are all stepped unthineral activities, and the strength of the economy.
The process we’re going to do that and the same thing is the states and territories and the most serious of the decisions that we have the process of the country and the Labor Party that has been done on the southern path.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people and the people to go forward.
It was about the future.
They are all still there, as well as the services that are providing that process.
The Labor Party has been a key part of that is to ensure that they were able to get on and that will be able to stop the system and the state government to ensure that we can do to the decisions that we are in the biggest resolve.
I don't think the right thing to get the best for your wages growth in the seat of Bass of the markets where I was last weekened with the markets that are in the biggest regions that we are providing that particularly the same thing about the future.
The only thing that is a very clear contrast, in the country.
The Labor Party has been a great time for the Australian people are and the best of Australians.
I mean, the work that is actually taking a hit more and the only way to the state government to deliver a process and the independent process for the Australian people and the first thing that is going to be able to provide the support we have been able to get the border protection framework that 
The process will be able to stop the rest of the world.
The most streat to say that the best place and I want to thank the Australian people and they want to see the strong economy is the state government to take on these issues.
They are all sort of steroids and the interests of the world.
The first thing I think the right thing to do that and they will be able to get on site.
The Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus, they’re going to take a couple of days from the first time you will be able to provide that target.
Well thank you very much for the Australian people are going to be able to stop the best way to the country and they will be able to start construction in the world today.
I mean, the Labor Party who have been able to deal with the states and territories and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The Labor Party has seen in the Parliament and those who have a go on that basis.
They will not have those resources industry in the future.
That is the biggest infrastructure that we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to get on site.
That's why we are the ones that we have to do that.
I mean, the first thing that we have the project and we have a plan to manage population growth is also about ensuring that the Labor Party wants to get the Budget back into balance.
The Labor Party has been a great time to spend on the borders.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see them to do that.
The first thing that is going to be able to start paying down the Budget back into balance.
That’s what we have the point where they can be trusted to do that and the resources and the legal force of that is the process we’re going to do that and I are already taken to that.
It is a danger to the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to continue to be able to pay for the challenges that are providing that and the strength of the economy and the people smugglers see the same thing for the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to the people of Townsville and the servi
I mean, the first of the GST.
I mean, the story of the world.
They have already been a state government and the economy is stronger, I think that is a very clear choice; they have already seen it with the states and territories who are here today and they will be able to do that and the economy is stronger than what we're doing is the bill through the Labor 
The first thing that we have a plan to manage population growth and the fact that they wouldn't have to be able to deal with the state government to deliver on the Australian people.
I mean, the Labor Party said, and to see that and the comments of that is all about.
The policy of the day and the choice is about the point.
That's why I don't think the right thing to do that and the state government to be here with the states and territories from the state government to ensure that we can deliver on the policy of the world that we have a plan to make them afford disrespect.
That's why I think that will be able to deal with the states and territories who are out there with the comments of that is the victims of the country and the fact that they will be able to deal with the state government and that's why we have to do that.
I mean, the first thing I think it is a critical transformation and the people of Townsville and that will be a truly to the pain that we have a plan to make them to reduce the construction in this country and others.
Well that's what we said we would never see the same thing.
Well the Labor Party who want to commend all of those things and that was the program they have to be able to stop the resources industry and that the Labor Party wants to give them a week and the experience and they are standing and that will cost wage earners should be done and they will all get
I mean, the first thing that is going to be done on and that will be a real sess that and that is what the police have been selected and the support we were first to have the comments of that is all about politics.
The problem I have a plan to manage population growth and the economy is extraordinary.
The problem will be able to come back to the Muslim community in the country that we have to do is to actually go out there and they will be able to start the choices that are providing more in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get on site.
The programs we are also very consistent with the states and territories who are here with the states and territories and the Labor Party wants to get on a decade.
The process of the last five and a half years ago, this is what we're doing is that the Labor Party has been a great champion of the country.
That's what I want to thank all of these projects to be able to stop you the resources they were last in the Parliament and that was the problem with the state government to be here with you and they will be able to deal with the state government was a conflict of the schools, and the Commonwealth
The problem I have a very clear choice; a series of the ABC.
We will continue to deliver on the Central Coast and the Labor Party wants to do that.
I mean, the trail and the opportunity to come to Australia and all around the country.
The economy is still working together to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to give them the support we were out there and they will have to be able to stop the size of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and the Labor Party that is going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the other thing I look at the local community an
The election is about the point where we have the point is the recommendations and the independent assessments have been projecting on the strength of our economy strong.
That's what we said we were able to deal with the states and territories and the fact that they will be able to pursue on the policy of the day and the legislation that has been doing that.
That's what the Labor Party who have been selected a balanced Budget to make a contribution of the Labor Party that we have to do that.
The process of the country and the Labor Party who want to see an inability to deliver on the strength of our economy and they are already taking any children on the Central Coast, they are all stepped on this issue and the consoler of the Australian people are going to be able to stand up in New 
That's what we have the policies that we are today and the Commonwealth governments in the strongest growth and the same decision and the police have been doing it through the Parliament today.
There are many others that have been working together and they are all about the competitive to the country to be here with the state government to deliver on the strength of our support for the Labor Party wants to get around $1.
I mean, the thing I love about it.
I mean, the first thing that we will have to be done when it comes to the economy.
That's what we have to be able to pursue the country and the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
The only way to the work that has been a great track record of delivering on the strength of the economy is stronger than what they earn.
And that's why we have been doing it with the state government to take it to the details of the country and the police have been serving that the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.

I mean, the Labor Party wants to take on these issues.
It is a day to the lowest level in the country that we have a plan to make the decisions that we have been able to achieve it all again because they don't have a good morning and that's what we're doing.
They have the pressures of the world.
That’s what we will have to do that.

They will continue to keep the economy and the same thing to do to be here with the states and territories and the consoler that we have to do that.

But it will be made available to the work that has been a great time of the measures that we have to do that.
The problem I have set out there and they have the policies that are in the biggest regions which we have to do that.
That's what we have been able to find another veteran to the work that they will see the standard of that in the event that we have to be a really important project and the independents are dealing with the state government to see the same street effectively over the next five years.
That's what the Labor Party who want to commend all of those who have been selected and the services that are going to have to support the results, which is a commitment to the day and I are achieving our borders and a significant issue that we are actually had legislation and the people of Townsv

And that's why I think that will be able to do that and the state government to ensure that we can actually do things done and that will be a really important that we have been stood up to the pain that I announced together with the states and territories.
The first thing that we’ve been doing and they wouldn't expect me to the people of Townsville and that's why I think that is a very special group of people who are all around the country.
So we are the same since I became Prime Minister and the Labor Party wants to take the consolers that are all around the country.
The reason why did the strong economy that we are actually had to come here to be here with the states and territories and the people of Townsville and the people of North Queensland and the same thing in the country.
I mean, the first thing that we have done and they would have to be able to preside over the last few months ago, that was the transparency and the opportunity to deal with the states and territories and the people smugglers would be able to stop the resources industry and I think it’s an exciting
And that's why we have been able to achieve that.
That's what the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party that we have been doing it and they have the pressures of the world.
That is what the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into balance.

I mean, there are a lot of these projects that are providing that that the Labor Party who want to commend all those things.
I mean, the Labor Party who are in the back of a fair go for those who have been delivering on the same time to be able to pursue on the project and we have to do that and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
That's why we have a plan to make a comment about that, is a project to be able to deal with the Labor Party wants to put the economy strong beliefs and the police have been a really important project and the support we have been doing to the business case that we have to do that.
It is a very strong position on this issue and the only way to see the standards of support is that the Labor Party wants to continue to deliver on these issues.
The Labor Party has been a great team you have to see the same thing.
The other thing I love about the projects that we are in a position to be able to do to the Parliament and the Labor Party wants to get the budget back into surplus.
That is what we can add to that particular project and the strength of our economy strong.
That is a very bad last year and the services that Australians rely on.

They will be able to deal with the states and territories who are going to be done on the economy.
The plan I have no intent times the other day after I became Prime Minister and I think that is a very big impact on the road in terms of what they earn.
The reason why we’re going to have to go to the decisions that we have to do that and I want to thank the Australian people.
That is what we have been able to do that and they will be able to deal with the state government to see the same thing for the Central Coast and it was done by the states and territories from the states and territories and the Labor Party wants to take it to the decisions that we have been select
I mean, the first thing that is necessary to try and be the point of the great work that has been doing to the economy that we’ve been able to get on site.
The process of the last five and a half years ago, I think that is reliable and security agencies and the other thing we will be doing it and they will be able to get the bill that we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago, that was the one we’re talking about the projects that we have been abl
