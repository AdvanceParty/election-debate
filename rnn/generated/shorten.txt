I like our Christmas Clock and his Liberal Party and Toyota Schools, in Australia is we support the Liberal Party has been here, it's a last six years.
Would say the Government's a reasonable English.
But I've come all of atice when we talk about going to less a couple in the honest and with real to a lot of public life our $9.
What we've done?
First of all, we've told me they've seen private health and a cheer and our concerns of Australia that they just offer hope the characterisation recording have been doing families.
It has to be doing this Government and more extreme right wing hate crazy cuts to him labour: I'm going to make sure that women makes you three of the Committee cheques for a this year, if I'm confident that the media, we are seeing for the stand of the question.
On her views says we're going to ask a choice.
They're running the fahling operate a union freeze on announce but see you and early childhood educators and Senator Morrison and see through the front better holidays because he had everything having announced more generally.
We are committed to state exempt under this government has been created a vote's wages policy, if they never give a ticket land when we know what you're getting fairness, and I'm sure we are going to take the door.
Labor on Australian politic who says we're going to do so.
My problem is we agree with people ...
This bloke so weren't women a really an environment centre in this country.
I think the Government, this is probably and airport.
Sometimes this weekend state as cracking and the nationi and so when you drive to at the never-never pay the wages, the Government is also complex with paid in table to have behind the proper funding and not dot what we want to impose home on a better deal shows the Inscycra in someone on this wee
That is a start of Australia have said that the Commonwealth of Australia, then you don't pay their brob sentence.
I also remind Melbourne.
We have put forward the Banking Royal Commission fights that you can do for the apprenticeships in a specialist, they can't contacted a bit of answer.
Labor hasn't run.
Got to stack up with my opinion to restore people within dollars and what you have a very important fact we've said we'll work with the Government's recolving Fruster Hospital.
What we are working price of background.
We've got the last five and a half years, an outstanding Clive Palmer has had to give Mondare, get rich particular service to the bottom line of talking about what the question is not sharing record $370,000 we should almost be trapped doing from an excuse book, sticky, they say that when this gov
What we want to improve the law wageE is a reasonable woman on the last five under employers.
We want to see more transparent interest prices for solar party for less interest in solar way to expossed when that we'll subsequemed the workplace to do that, and not handed out of funding strong economic plans.
We've seen in extreme right wing hate crimes or Queenslanders, clamping our schools and his government.
This summer is next.
We have not in this country.
Labor Party and too of the mums and as they have chased their wages policy.
Doesn't want better funding over consumntant.
But if you want to see us last year airport when it was serious great cases are good and we have the well-off and I started in South Australia events, it's not a project of consumer.
The first three years when he was this bus of the Tasmanian law of our posls are seeing - but it's in the basket of bould or two now.
Wheneven you don't get bigger tymes anything out of view $37 million to buy legislating since their whole life of pay and they're looking forward that answered the Chief Minister wants to see us with the nation say we've seen the council is a very strong debate.
And today if you vote for Launceston and I don't think is that we have a better suburban railw is right through to the time or market the issue.
And what a very skick of massive out of the Coalited Peter Dutton Gillp remarkable Coalition I suspect and we're outlining all the door and this is al enough in Canberra that we need a deal with a united team, if you future in a government but listen, who has been a billboard in the interests of w
But this stuff which would we can't do one goes on pensioners with fear approach.
I'll end the bank between $11 billion out of the flood appalling, and they've been certainly not- sorry knock there.
Oh no doubt that that we are going to finally need it up, that's all of the thousands of explosed under the challenge in Australia or anything else.
Thanks, everybody, everybody, this I have got a property investor of guest about not afraid.
We're hopesing - we get elected, on our biggest problem with preferentially complicate for the reef of hate safety not just taxary and it's they?
So I have a look at the top end of town.
When you look at the boats.
What we're going to do is talk about the loss of Canberra haven't worked or loving on its position certainly paid not any qualificate resources of having an absolute so that is not the council why Mr Turnbull knows that everybody and we would voted for the Northern Territory Andrews and no complet
My fighting and business is treated a change and send a $600 million to put prefter your family and a seems of In terms of eight, we're currently pretty straightforward that this summer and Chloe and Palmer is not a significant campaign too show, we've been decided a ticket facilities and what we'
What I also think that they are so billions of dollars to the whole lot more and, I want to close that if you - traffic taxpayer money.
They're certainly going to protect our $2,000, but Mr Morrison ward that we have raised assistance next speechs, amendment that you have done a massel.
Until he didn't want to have a lot more fair dinkum of the current story, there's no mental health pool, if they can get to all the cost of scare campaign.
I finish youâ€™ll make sure that we can actually followed televisions for the people.
6 million, this would know this Government is cooperate cars here.
And as a fair go for me.
The traise Papua New South Australia are not the issue today and I really make this Government has worked.
I think the Government has handled because they look after the fact that they are handing out in some recovery record.
That is why I actually like to have a modest and do we want to do is we want to commit to go.
That's why we should be an extra price to the bottom line days.
We want to make sure that we are going to sell the extremism other than I am pleased that we're going to pay the cuts to penalty rates - no one pursue the nation?
I've said we are on the next three years.
They are up to work to the law wage is a making sure that we can do the local contract which are a problem with me just an exciting new generation to defend a good idea think.
And what we see the cuts to schools and our policies are not retrospective.
We will do is we are saying there are immigrational propositions on the Liberal Party and the things we are going to talk about climate change political parties like I have 12 in any Queensland who the clean- the Government in eight months I said that they're talking about a fair go for people who
I am very leave a special measure of the Chinese Commission to make sure that Australian wage earners so that if we get elected when we sort of older Australians that the government is going to make sure that we need a big gind of the days of an in the hope that we present some of the thousands of
They just took and double on being a cause or exciting plans will have more to say sorry, they can be ashamed of the future.
And I'm not going to be a recipe for seven weeks.
But the point about it is about her own post which doesn't agree with our borders subsidy to have a doubt that the Government needs to get better and dividends and had a real problem in Australia have been to be a climate change policy and see complete and do extraordinary pay the banks should be 
The reason why we have a lot of cancers, they are the debate about the damage of funding for the day advist.
I can restore the rest of the Liberals and Newstart is also confident if we want to find out the credit card that if we have seen the great policy is running a billion dollars and the local big corporate motor and then even happened which we are going to sit down and decency and all of a couple ri
So what I can get it right now.
So we're offering the extreme right wing extremists with it.
The real reason why here, if they are going to reform the Prime Ministers are the best way to change that if the Australian people want to make sure that they can't be providing the Government of Australian politics so our kids get a living wage.
I am not going to reverse the wages.
It is a referendum on energy policy.
That is why we're going to do is pay the full time to pay for the world, be anything else of the scans in the past or a Labor Government in Canberra can't afford to come along to the Liberal Party of Australia, that the Government doesn't leave it our legal and stubbor view.
I have got a different set of funding so that is a real staff at the moment.
But I'm going to make sure that we can tell you in this country because we are there money to the next election you've got a position of what I can get that sort of culture on the above the local contracting values of the same time.
That's why I can have to stop that.
The reality is that they're not listening to the people of Australia over the next two years ago, we have a national security experience than the extreme right wing attitude becomes up they learn to say that you do a person need to be a shame from experience to make sure that women get regards a c
So if I would like to have to be better that they're a subsidy of mining and cars from the subsidy to Parliament, the Senate has a lot of good enough on this.
I am completely as it is so important to the announcement for a million families aren't means that a lot of unity but I remember you will have more to say in the election, that they've seen our policies.
What that means is that Mr Morrison not just a crossbenchers, when they've been a support.
This government couldn't want to talk about some of the Labor Party I mean the Government.
We are properly funding our care who have been making the bills.
So what we are all fuMend the workforce of the people of Australia, they're going to put downward pressure on their own convenial particular work in the nation.
I were unfair to say that we should recognise that.
I've got the policy which is going to have a development of the Liberals have gone up 45 per cent of our care, we have an interest of the Budget in the Senate and I am not so much and really another three years to pay their carers.
The ideas and help people don't have to be consumed by the national election of who at the next six weeks and secure by refund what the problem is cancer treatment right through the cuts to penalty rates as well as we were seeing in the world what they've certainly been going to be the public tran
I think it's a real complete Australians who would like to stack up competition with the health and the rest of the three years as the processes that the shadow Cabinet at the Commonwealth health outcomes in the number of households and reversing the detail for a fair go for the next three years, 
Now, I don't accept that we should deal with Penny Wong - they can stay pay up the opportunities to the children to ask Mark to support the whole of the National Party of Australia are not, want to be a market.
Well I've been thinking in the Senate and all the Government said he wants to do it with the Government ran the last tworen feminised in the record is - I saw the fact that it is a very fish kills to leave to the internet last night between $67 million dollars and boast and the Government as just 
The privatise is going to specifically please that Mr Turnbull has had a debate with the promises who come out this issue of Australia.
If you had your changes we are united.
What we will make engineed and refugees.
More of the future.
Our bridge on climate change Morrison, the current Prime Minister Turnbull couple and we will do is give you to bring it on a wages policy, we now like to hand over to Catherine King to talk about wages.
What I would put it back to work.
So when you look at it.
So what we're going to do wait a tradie of what they are doing it haid to pay their jobs and working prices under this government has got a Federal Government who is going to be the children and the banking royal Commission.
Happy to take a letter of the three years.
I said we want to talk about someone in Australians and we want to change our wages guarantee from the accepted to an independent veictimar.
So in terms of the progressive role, a position is as sure that Tony Abbott and Nationals on the future.
I don't think that in Australia so when we see what the politician of Australia, we have a trade to promote the man who won't do is and you all know it.
I mean they've already put very straightforward.
But we are using the balance leave a person everyone.
Do you know this current government doesn't subsidise the same time when they have so many outcome of your own.
I think the problem is that we're going to do is talk about the board stage of the Liberal Party to talk about the people of Australia is a very important issues in this country.
So I don't know what they are saying that we want to get the best part of the election and the current Prime Minister Turnbull struffaul.
I don't think that the Government's proposing to see a specialist he was the chaos in Australia, the current government in Canberra who has been a big problem in Australia and the state Government and they're a real choice to the people in the last few years ago.
So I think the Government has got a plan for the next three years ago.
I think that is a crack by the last five and a half years of policies deserve a lot of the future of the scandals and the current Prime Minister Turnbull said that we want to see more than the last five and a half years of the election to supplement the case to the top end of town.
The real issue is that when we can do that the current Prime Minister of Australian politics in the next 10 years of the people who are going to preserve our changes which will say that we're going to do is tell the country which is what the second thing the Government of Australia are safe and th
The real issue is that when you get the chaos in the past with the same time to make sure that we are going to do is cut people with the treatment of chaos.
I don't think the real conservative government with the people of Australia that we're going to see the people of Australia is an exciting new investment in the last few years ago.
I don't think that the Liberals said we are going to start the cost of the next election.
I think the people of Australia and the current Prime Minister of Australia and the current Prime Minister of Australia is that the Government has no plan for the next three years ago.
I think the Government who has no plan to reverse the penalty rates and the record in the election.
The real problem is that when you look at the seat of the Liberals and the Government and the subsidy in the last five and a half years ago.
I want to see more people who are going to take action on climate change and the record and the scare campaign to take a long term alone of the surgical process and they will be a real choice and the subsidy to the election to supplement the current government who has got a great card which is to 
I think the Government is going to say that if you can get the chaos and the workers they said they've got a plan for the last five and a half years of the Liberal Party and the Government of Australia is that when I said that they don't have the chance to talk about our changes to the extremists 
The real problem is that the Government says we are going to do is really call the state and the current government with the treatment of the Government on climate change and we are going to do is make sure that we will do is put the right to a lot of our candidate for the Australian people want t
The real issue is that we can do that the regulators and the rest of the community and a half years ago they can get the best position they can't afford to do is talk about the next election and the current government schools.
The real issue is that the people who are going to do is again the reasons and then they can say that they haven't done the debate about the election and the state election and the current Prime Minister Turnbull and that's a good thing that the Government has got the chaos on the top end of town.
I think that the Government said we want to make sure that we can do is make sure that we want to do is we want to make sure that we can do that.
The real issue is the Government is a real problem with the cost of living is a government who has no plan for the last five years of course of the elections are going to see a doctor of the problem with the cost of living is going up except wages.
The reality is that the Government agree to the people of Australia is a country which says that we can do that.
I am going to do is tell you what we have a government who has nothing about the people of Australia which is a real choice and the record in the first time the cost of living is a death tax cuts for the future of Australia, the next election.
The real problem is that when we were talking about the people of Australia is an extra 20 per cent of our commitment to help work with the cost of living and what we want to do is make sure that we can help with the state of the election and the Prime Minister of Australia and the Government is a
I want to say to Australians are going to do is talk about the people of Australia are a particular set of books for the nation.
But the world should be a country who has been a national energy policy and they don't want to see some of the last five and a half years of the Labor Party is not working with the current government who has got a plan for the top end of town.
We want to restore the truth of the problem with the environment to talk about the current government is going to give a lot of people who are a marvellous policies we've got a plan for the work of the Liberal Party and the rest of the election with the cost of living and a half years ago they are
I am sure that we can do is make sure that we can do a lot of the last five and a half years of the last five and a half years and we want to see the government and the surrounding area of the next election.
We want to restore the penalty rates of the people of Australia is a government who is going to do is talk about our children is the private health insurance becomes an exciting new in Canberra who have been a big problem that we are going to do is to consider that they are going to see the door.
I don't know what we want to do is really distracted the subsidy to the local community.
I think the Government has got to realise that the Government has got the council was a country who can't afford to be a bit of a strong economy.
I don't know what we want to do is talk about the last two of the people in this country.
I think the Liberal Party and that's what the Government has been a blocking to see the Government on climate change and the way that the Government has been a country who can't afford to be a very strong economic reforms to say that we're going to do is real cheaper and the work which is too long
So we are going to do is a private health insurance and the current government and we can do that.
The real problem is that the government is going to be a lot of a death tax cuts for the next three years ago.
The real problem is that the Government has said that we want to restore the cuts to hospitals in the next three years ago.
I don't know if you want to see more people who are a wages policy.
I also think that is a big problem in the world.
I don't think the current government and the other thing is that when we were a great card which will do is to see what the Government has got to reduce the detail of the state and get the ability to be a bit of a million Australian households and the rest of the same chaos in the Senate.
We are going to do is tell you that the Government is subsidies for the future.
They said they can have a look at the people and the extreme right wing hate speech.
They want to see the same time to talk about climate change policy and the regions.
I think the government says that the Government has got to pay for the council back to the extremists.
I think that we are going to do is to say that if you are a problem with the current government schools.
They are going to put the debate about the people who are a lot of people in the next three years when they can bring those comments we will do is talk about the people of Australia are left to the ability of the problems that they are going to see a doctor or a bit of a strong economy and the res
The real issue is that the current government is a fair go for all Australians that we can do that.
I think the Liberal Party to say that they have a look at the public system in Australia and the current government in Canberra that the Government is not a pretty good in the world.
I think the Government has said that we want to be a country who has a problem that we have a government who is going to do is again the reasons why they are saying that we are going to do is to have a great card which will do the wages moving again things about the people who are saying that we w
They don't have a look at the cost of living is to do something to announce that they are out of control.
I want to see more treatment of the election will be a lot of Australian politics is going to be a country who doesn't have a look at the price of the last five and a half years of our exciting policy and in terms of the current government has got to pay for the future.
The reason why we are going to do is talk about the conceppect of the children in this country.
The real issue is that the Government is going to be a bit of consumers and we're going to see the same surgery than the Government has no plan for the future of the election and the cost of living is going up except people's wages.
What we're going to do is just find an excuse that they are doing it and the fact that South Australia, has said she's looked at the top end of town, the reason why we're going to do.
That will generous on the tumily by the law, they actually wouldn't make you poor.
The reality is that she has about born and it will make ends meet.
I did say there's a sensible support for the first home guest services and taxpayerf.
Our changes to properly fund up their six-years of the same of Melbourne to the next election has fallen on the betterment briefing the truth is we've been prepared to rush and our party has gone up by putting government, about the fact that people haven't been pretty generation on this view to si
Mr Morrison has known.
But nonetheles that the companies are going to help them how everything has no plan to roll up and support for the future.
They say to all the Australian people.
I will also make sure that we are providing the cuts to penalty rates is called the housing population in the last six years, the state election in Bill Shorten General HigLab at our packages, calls.
So there's no role over $100,000 impayed the process isn't welcome the cost of living government to make sure that we want to intervent in health care and I don't want to see more out of pocket costs of secure.
Yeah, you know, it's not the bottom in the next five mich.
We've been to say about a vote in the House of Representatives can be deterred because of the kids missing out.
And in fact we are to come back to you.
But there's a bit of a fair go all the out-of-pocket costs to supplement and working with no from a lack of parents in this country, the politicians get a fair go.
She got every parents you'd the other cards, he started his father was the role of Australia Day.
We are going to help clear.
But the first thing, that comment this government just one person for our lead of the boards of reference, we intend to do it.
Just again, property investors and aged care in their customers, and then I also say this; well that you don't know what they didn't get more out of control.
This is not a swim but it's good news for the top end of town.
We're going to do is give you farmers and the companies who have had to do so.
There's too much us what the only program in the Senate, to put some more generous sometimes where they were running a lot of abuse.
We've said politics, and I say to Tanya Plibersek and Brendan O'Connor.
There aren't going on to swim, but I will get the same exemption which this government has had a lot of good things about the people.
The surrounding initiatives to be a bit of $200.
The status quourchifist.
The thing is that the big parties of Australian politics which is because when the first two years Australian people want to do it that we're happy to say that if we get elected the Commonwealth health costs and I get that there have gone up except most of our fellow Australians come tower that ha
We're going to work through the truth.
I'm not going to go in power in politics.
But it is so plus to try and we're going to give Queensland current Government can be reported me of say something for their sixth house.
But it was a bitter deal to patients get a very good slight which is an everyone electric vehicles are getting a long hand they can't agree on the future, we're not in place for a very good income tax in the first two years for cars here.
The reality is that us, we're not going to forgive that things about my Deputy and Malcolm Turnbull would still be guided by the way to go back to them is a coal miner.
That's one of the same people, especially impressively can do to Townsville and 13 days ago and I do believe that what we're doing is I hope wages are just a half years of pay and the remarks of support for you, the big price united pathology and created international commission to the cost of chi
If the Government addictering our kids and new coal-fired power, but for me, which will create a ticket chaos, we did all, you have a fair go and business but for the Liberal Party and in charge of the ABC to the number one Prime Minister and hello many of you know it's all about the top end of to
I think the real issue here is the current Treasurer in the Senate waiting lists for games.
Our plan, and then someone who is ambitious about how we have been at viewed them is a show.
But I think very field on this or madnes of trustees the cuts to Territorians, I'm certainly going to be a political football with so many of the real choices.
These are them and give a fair go and confirm that in other parts of Federal Labor working with individual media complex, I'm here because the government story, and what we're going to have a national energy mix going on background, is the politicians haven't got the government in this country is 
First of all, three us some of the Government and the scientists who make up scare campaigns.
They don't pay tax deduction in the world, but the point about it is a deal with the Premier Services.
Now you sadly cemently above the people of Australia and the decision what they can get the same issues and the best of many sector, and I'll put to all the advocacy.
They've got real change to the only people smugglers to Australia because when they are not going to be looking for more policies for his teams and considered credits.
What we will do is say to the conservative boats, we're not fair that we see here today is that early pressure on their commercial dynamic and the equivalent media on the cost of living pressures and divisions, we're going to finish home but to invest in politics?
I do believe in the complete conscience, a message I never believe in this country.
When you want to talk about the economy and whatever you say that we can say that they're going to be fair dinkum on the history of Australia, doesn't have the right thing to help them.
In fact, not just being a bit to discriminate against children, is part of Australia.
I think because the Government and then they feel president of the insurer campaign on the sort of security.
So we've got to make sure that there will be no climate schools and shares, would still be the carpet from the guise that it is what happens and complete big business case in the interests of workers.
We will provide $2000 dip on the first thing.
That's fair that we need to pick a fair go at the contract but anyway, there's a minimum wage into a billion dollars means you know, it is a shame he wants to have a better chance the trifecta answer that they are up for by a proper ideas, but even where I think that's why we're focused on climate
Well I don't have the ruise community to be affected it in the roads.
The point about it is a cost of the future of the matter is when a government can make sure that we decided that around Australia.
But what I'm going to do more on our climate policy before an election is to make sure that you would have a debate here, is that the people of Australia which is I think that I am provide by the context here, so they have said that they have provident amongst them the banks at the banks and the p
They're doing.
The reality is the problem that have been affected.
So we will do is asser our promises on the top end of town.
You know, even a government who lost a decade for change.
It's in the recent of the matter is the fact that the independent?
I've got a talented team, which has been out there.
I'm not saying that all the people who are saying that they're not giving the last six years.
But what I can say to those existing media platforms they've just looked at that town since the community through Australians.
But it's a very brief in the bush, the cuts to confidence in the past.
The problem is that when you go to the government and making sure that the big citizenship tests because we've been there.
But I think that if you want to see action on climate change.
The fact that they want to see a very strong candidate in Canberra who has shown that because we are backing in the previous microres.
We've come to the detail.
I mean if they were meeting jobs in the interests of people with a major support for it in the budget that defence depends to a property on other political future to be with my party who doesn't matter if you've got our leadership now.
The facts is when people are letting the health work here.
We're happy to take this facility is a future generation on climate change, a where that's not the chief and childcare.
The hospital in the preservation of first home, no companies lift the children of the same surgery that they want to say to a foreign policy.
That is why we can provide more cheap from their pay.
Well there's a lot of good news for you.
We will do is make sure that we get that your first step in the national anti-corruption commission.
Labor has deliberately make sure that when they can't afford to do that, then I don't know your power bills by the problem with the environment and subbies what it is, if you want to talk about waiting lists for charge there are plan for the future.
What we won't refer the same remotior in this country is the regulators and we are committed to reducing me to the bottom of the story as the current crew.
I think there's an exciting new investment, in the past or how to see our very fortunatee of the other thing this government has gone up 45 per cent, and the other thing which says, people want to talk about priorities.
We will work through the price because perhaps $90,000, one of the way the pressure is not providing a lack of government schools.
And today's a modest and not just a bit of a million Australian households help with what we see is we can do is not be a climate change politics, which have a facility for more of the community has been trying to put $77 billion to the Liberal Party, and the leader property or out of touch as lik
And what we've said that if poor old Mr Morrison I say that we want to do is we will be a lot more about the other matters?
It's about their bus to the front line games we've struggle the strong economic reform decisions.
And we've got a whole deal for social media is like a property or for a long time in the Senate who has the money to unless the employer state on the box.
He has had a disaster.
They're on the policies.
The thing I am no sort of unfair manner would still be back to you, the other fellow, and indeed the department, in the last few years of cuts to hospitals, the current Prime Minister to be in electric vehicles.
They want to see every other people's ministers who are the same politicians who don't have the future for them when the experts tell me, we are going to have the same political football and the Government is so an address this government has just given up to $14.
If the social media policy, they haven't said that we want to be a country but this government which is a cost to taking action on climate change.
And in the Liberal Party is the barrel area to someone who end the trustees for cancer in the first round.
Thanks everybody, but I think the Government has been said the problem for example.
I wish the number of that there is a death tax subsidies for the first time so that there is no doubt starts having an energy superpower of the scandals over the next three years of a much modernisation funding for the future of people who have been resourced that we can make sure that the problem
The Government are in the next three years.
Cancer, and what this government is pretending that we get that recommendative gas casualists, why do they can't get the path of the property investor can explaining that the conservative, from all the whole time.
I mean we know they want better before the Liberal and North Queensland, if you want the government should be a bit further about this issue, when the Liberals are high.
We are not going to say in terms of reforming the facts, we certainly supplement this - what we've said we're going to contemplate thousands of story.
But I'm not going to take action on climate change and it's not just a complete income tax.
We want to hear.
There's a lot of good opportunity to give the volunteers and the best people want to resolve the cuts to hospitals, and I am proposing, it's all about choices.
But what I do think that the Government went home to spend money from their carbon pollution in the unsustainable support in the last six years that the government has the chance to be here with the election to do the Australian people, the second idea the fact that they've travelled the detail.
We're talking to a house and politics is the cost of living is now so long as other matters?
The government has always got to have the same has grown about the fact that means that which is going on about our commitment to provide a good have got to do.
I'm not sure from all the truth.
When you think about that now is that there is a very sensitive community policy.
But one of the current government.
I don't know what we want to hear from someone at all.
They want to invest more than $1000 if the street before the Liberals say they have been precared to be here on the vision of economic plans at the polls.
We'll go to the pensioners and the conservatives who have had no plan for the future for that.
So we're going to say to those any models - I haven't fallen in the next five mental health and hospitals.
Yes.
Labor is saying that it all of us who may the people might just offerful tax refunds for the future and renewable energy and scare campaigns with the deal.
I remember the level of claimed that we are going to do is prioritise, we want to make Prime Minister, Labor is out of touch that we need to have a proper talented team, for millions of dollars of the past.
We've got to make sure that we are going to do the right thing by members of the instability.
So the problem in Australia.
What we want to have a blocking against kids off Nauru, which will save the banks to perhaps even more money to need a political system.
So I think the problem is that the Liberals have the power to all the other hand are so far a ring of every children.
We want to do is make sure that they ever invested in their parents, we've got to call out the cost of living and it's just in the last six years to implement it.
Well first of all, which is one of the business, look after the key united deal for the future of Australia are the fact that the price of the last six years of the national security opening to an excuse batteries, when you get to the workers on the terms of reforming the debate.
I think the government.
You can do that before I think that he is a day of action who earn a privilege to you are still about the extreme right wing power, and we need to use the right.
I've been shorted in the fact that the Commonwealth issues in Queensland, the government should be in their parents.
The fact of the matter is that the circus but I'm not prepared to say they said this government's deciding the target of the next election.
Well that's the last election, which will see some of the previous quote.
They are providing a newspaper that no million Australians who are experiencing the people.
They haven't got the Gold Coast is the biggest problems in the last five and a half years, not totally discovered by the debate, we'll do the same plan because we're going to be a country who have been to take real action on climate change.
I have a business model of the reasons why they can have to have a reflection of new coal-fired power.
I'm not going to do it and we are committed to making sure that we provide the recommendation of tragitious new issue.
I think that is a sense to talk too, but the politics is because they have a cost of child care, health care.
Well we are sick of the matter is the cost of talkable.
Okay I think the Government has seriously learning to the future to big business.
We have got to resolve any particular bonus.
I mean about it.
The real issue is that we say to the bar behaviour.
We'll be a lack of the Australian people have to be very committed to be able to be called.
I don't know if you could have proper funding for coming up by people.
You don't want to scare Australia and he doesn't have a more profit, in the national interests of this government.
I mean the government for a couple of years ago and I think we got the truth of the next election.
We are a really not the non-conclusion of the other fellow, the Liberals another unsubbies for a tax increasing new programs.
I just don't take action on climate change policy.
But the reality is that when the Australian people will be feeling medical cities which will allow out of the problem that Mr Morrison wants to see a doctor and the banks holders, who are hate a second less than $180,000 to its discrimination against children where the government schools to the ab
We are not going to save the current Government can be a country who the community put all the division.
So what we see every two years to pay their housing prices.
We are having to get the same time to the bottom of the government they have been shocked out there.
Wherever you line it.
I think they want to love the country which is competing on in the banks can do as it optimite.
We are going to work with our policies - it's in the nation that is the interests of workplace relations: it's a disaster things about the minimum wage.
That is costing on the light rail.
There is a very good idea.
I don't know what they have said that we can do is including the top end of town.
I say to the level of confidence.
This is a government who is he?
We've had their fifth and we'll have a look at the policy which will do the government says against the cost of living.
It is a way to say you don't believe the problem with everything that they're going to make sure that we're going to preserve our commitment to time someone who is pretty straightforward.
I think this is a government who is enough costing Australians.
This is an exciting vision for Home Affairs Minister because they haven't done in the future for the extreme right wingers over the next eight months.
Do you know, what we'll have a look at the community and divided the banks.
He still receive relations which Labor is going to invest in renewable energy is the cost of the growth is the community to explain why they were all about choices.
There are measure to perhaps from the political system when the Government is down and stop the Government who is a vote in the Pacific, and I want to say to Australians: "Why can they do got that an investment in this country, it is not the Australian people and our station that we enter the best
I don't know anything else who the Manus and Nauru, Transie are the knuckle of the world, and we don't think the reason why Mr Morrison must belong to you, but this Government where the Parliament is going to confirm: if the Royal Commission.
The government is going to be here on our war on a strong story.
The real issue is that the cost of the fact that we can get the best inquiry has wate a government who is going to vital with the centre of this country, the fact that they get into the parents or seeing that have been modest but if you want to know what this government doesn't matter what happens
The reality is that it is a good officient set by modernised of the amendments, we can make this has been ahead of $928 to the far north Queensland?
Because what we want to do is talk about penalty rates.
We got the patients who have got the same time and the States really stopped by this country and the cost of not getting them to the Parliament.
I mean it would be a party who have got the first election but the person has got to be a fund to mentioned by what this government says it's a vote in the world to talk further about the tourism investment in the first three years with Mr Palmer, cost to pay their jobs in the Parliament.
This government is about study where they do the whole story and big companies and the rules in a suburban - State Government, if we are going to invest the same start than the fact that regional Queensland.
Most people - what this Morrison government in new technology and pulling more people to try and consume that was very well of the surgery which they will get Catherine to talk to the housing.
The fact of the matter is that this country and it's about tipping for the economy, and income is that if you want to put downward pressure of climate change and chaos.
And if you've got to be a carbon pollution before the Senate was the Environment and all the money which is what we want to have a good idea.
It is very inticity for division.
The reality is that there is a country which is too low.
And that is actually happening is that this government which other than I think the problem is yet again this stuff and we want to let the first time to be as serious and it was a very important role as I responding out the parts.
Labor's got a very fooler workers and we will be happy to take action on climate change.
This is a great job on this, we've had a couple of weeks and far north Queensland?
But for me, the cost of living and getting himself or is an adult working families, to have a lot of good?
And when they're going to forgive the private sexation because it's about the pensioners which is the country which is divided.
And what we've seen in the suburban rail.
We will always promised Chief Minister deals for their most politics is the policies which has been getting a lot of people who haven't got to pay for the internet hours and the fact that they wouldn't worry about this as a recretic violence starts and it was expensive under this government and th
But what I can speak to the campaign.
What we see is it can't take a virtue.
When you think that the questions that the Government is a matter of stability.
The Government is proposing theship which has no wages policy.
I mean, the other thing this government are common their kids to consider the bipartisan can be positively and was really keeping up down to the Government and the government has said that we will do is do is provide $120 shifty and the Liberal Party and the Top End?
But we need to give a lecture of people have had the chance the government wants to talk about health insurance is fundamentalise they are sick of the workforce.
So I think that doesn't mean they are.
They have not seen a carbon pollution in the first round.
Do you vote for Mr Turnbull and every money is for the nation that the Government's been able to fund parliamentary committee to be satisfied which is an option that there is no needing recredock or anyone in positions for consumers of the issues, that they are doing is this government is a chance
But I think that is what we're going to do is currently need to give $80 million to resolve and we are going to do more to say how it is a bit story, all the government is trying to do that because we are going to have a world in the fact that they have seen their fair share of tax subsidy.
Well I better have been able to do but I am not sure that we earns training that we do provide the media and there's a good idea why we're going to have the polls to pay for our kids too.
It is a really strong economy's gut the policy is because they get the out of pocket costs for the Government and the Shoalhaven here who are positive policies to say that we won't do that.
What we want to get here to the leader seat of South Australia, and then they have been a high decade of us, of the table, this election is all up to the Territory in the Senate to the local problems of community groups are once your power bills by providing an area cuts and middle-class Aussies.
I have committed to the interests of working and to make the same rule of small business.
When you think it's not a strong action on climate change and I am here with the patient rebate.
I think it is not the rubbish and the Government has had an employer should be in the fight of their curriculum retirement.
That's why we are not committed to vote.
And the new medical treatment to go to you.
We got the assets of the fastest-growing cases, the payment but I think that the grow use of the dams, the Liberals are providing the single biggest issues, the first time as the ability to talk about this recently is a cost to make sure that we have a different person they just say they're not my
This will stay in local and make sure we are going to restore the world in this country and that's what we need to do is talk to what the government's fair dinkum on the board, and I don't hold herself with the congestion of the election.
And we want to make sure that we get elected, in part time for the same as the wife matter about you all against children why does it as we have put forward a Royal Commission.
They can afford to be here at the laws of Australians.
What we want to do is make them more than they're doing here is other sixth or seventh outcomes, you know they've changed in the first two million Australians get to a team now.
We need to get the treatment of public hospitals and neglect but some sort of, all the Government will let you sending our policies, the time you can reverse the same as the complete opportunity to pay for their life in elections should not be seen their great future in the last six years and view
I mean, let's just say to the people who are saying that the Government deprivating the cuts to hospitals and that's a shopping women in Australia - the government, one of the senior policies on the future for a land candidate not only do we want to make sure that we play all of their watch, and I
I think the Government are actually happy to take some of the future sweet as well.
Well, what they're owed to be here at the provision and the pensioners and the political football and I think the Treasury visiting Melissa Price and Lointon, Australians safe a bit of a fair go for the second point in Australia, this current Treasurer.
I do think that people might have here because we can provide real changes to lift the best can be trusted by their lives, and the McGowan Anthony, I was thinking about it.
The other thing is a real problem under Laundard and also that is a referendum on the hospital, and I think the government who keeps them the rest of the stuff they never mention what we will do it.
It's not just a big cost of living is going up except your wages.
I mean his wrong in Melbourne and we're going to spend the technology else to the Parliament about it being a fair go as politicians comes to childcare business is the future of the option, there is the rest of the world and I think it is a good work.
Well we are going to get wages moving again, what we see is the big of great back at the moment.
Well we've got the same surgery with national security laws for the work for the Australian people, maybe you're not getting a wages policy, he should be given.
They are going to find $1 billion for a particular to keep the runs on health care system is that the Turkish is too hard to be a shame and start the government has gone up 20 per cent completely, and of course then there's a lot more to get the facilities and then not to have a better set of book
We're going to make sure that Australians should be giving the politics, we will consider that.
This is the regulators.
What we need to do a lot of our budget and their kids to the top end of town, and they're truttled as a result that she told me the next five years' .
We've told me the more professionals not rushing after themselves here and Palestine and the politicians and I think we've got to take anywhere money killereation about a strong balance which is shrinking people's wages.
But the missing link here and the government is running around the Liberal Party and I for one think that's why we're going to talk about that money to go to the course of a strong story for a decade of the top end of town.
But one of the first thing.
Well I think the first two per cent.
We are saying that what the Prime Minister.
I think that when they go home when they can get treatment and see here, in the number of years ago you know, because they don't want to protest greater issue.
We want to help the view in this country from Opposition Leader, if you want to talk about me, they don't have a proposal to the other point.
The reality is that when they're sick of the matter is that the way the people of Australia, who are treated to provide better health and we've seen is an explanation to pay everything in this country that does in the next eight months.
This is not the people who are running around Australia he's announcing $68,000, it is not the people.
We will work through the Government they can do that.
Sorry, I mean if they don't help people in the hydrogen revolution which I'd rather see the doctors and facilities to all the discussion which is confident that the government's been affected.
Thanks, Catherine to talk further about this but I fundamentally want to finish up the male decisions and the beginning stage.
But a family household for the Senate.
I would pick up to them.
This Government is promising positions to the regulators have gone up 39 per cent of the fact that the Government is trying to make a conference over the best staff, even the Government is so busy know that for the last three years of working together.
It is a calmy discussion with the stuff term that in the world.
That's why Labor is going to get live music in these community.
But it was a bit more money first adults and our plans and the payment policy with the Great Barrier Reef.
Listen, I think the big minister of the world.
We are looking at the fact that they'll say this; I think it said there is a party of the market, and we have got a fair go.
But again, I think the Liberals when they have to wait and then have come from a lot more than the extremists and they would want to see a taxpayer subsidy to visit to Canberra, let's get their opinions but I don't think that the Liberals in the House of Reps, the legitimate issue the right thing,
When you look at universal and exploitative for a largest contract to deal with the complete support for the Australian people in this country is about the same changes to early childhood educators will be a trade for households and the experts to try and more people from the government.
It is a spouse of the subsidy that the problem is we are going to invest in new renewables sakes they can get the best hospital working with the fact that we've done an extra $50 million after the first time that Mr Morrison is office they want to assumption to the hospital in the Territory.
Now, if the investment in new accountants in the bottom quarter, but it's too low.
I don't know what they were silly about what is the number one issues in this country.
Well first of all we're going to not experious at the end of his own past on them with disability.
Listen, I think the Government doing more story and we'll have time some of the matter is the Bureau of Melbourne and Labor's got a lot of providing an argument of the issues in those pay.
The other thing which is Gladstone, are good enough for the western political party says it's in government stuck in their faith.
This is not what you have to deal with it into advocating policies.
This is the party into the banks and Wentwonds, and you know, and then at the next election.
I have a policy is the people.
They've said we can do is talk about that.
I think the same committee to making the priorities where they get the best mandate who loves they have got to have a look at the environment and the workers have to further - the problem that he is been struggling to talk to you is the way that there's a debate the sop the future with instability
This is a government who has gone up 40 per cent mental health seniors care, appreciable in the middle of the people of Australia that we have had dight months.
It is a billion dollars of thousands of people to be better than the government bowel concerning as a calm by the people of Australia is that question which is very committed to our skin carry on a anternational process.
If you are born, that is so important that this wouldn't reflect twite to see the penalty rates arbitrarily, means that was the election.
In terms of them to the bottom for cancer is sick and tired of explanation to be relying on the terms - they were already worried about far north Queensland.
This is a government who is such a policy to pay the ballooning costs to go to the Government where people are getting people here and Wide Bay railway allowing people with disability is that this government realises.
I know that when it comes to getting the best health system not new investment in explaining from the last three years of this community for Far North Queensland.
I'm very optimistic signs of the nation.
We want to be a nation who gets an unawar industry and our banks honest?
But the difficulty or on top of our ideas and we're going to help the government of undermining people and hospitals, courtesy of discrimination against children with the independent umpire when we make sure that everyone else competition is that that is a very important issues in this election an
That's why we're going to need to ask the status quo is silly experiencing wages or what worries me about wages policy.
Our policy work with the costs of cancer, and then they know it's the children and the very northsidle religious education, and they've been having a number of home because they have solar rooftop.
Why is it that they do.
One of the most important, and the big problem for the government and say it's about how they come back, they didn't agree with this country got any debates.
In the interests of working people to make sure that fighting to invest in half a more question which says he knows they've learnt the world and four year olds - the other hand and support in the cities and the surf line wage stagnation.
But why is it that there are thousands of dollars away from what the Government is determined to be able to protest a plan for women and the bus is excellent about the price of funding for this remarks of the nation.
I don't think anyone who can properly fund outlined by all the banks honest?
This is a sense of health, and the access to employer because we've got to spend taxpayer subsidy to pay their taxes to the environment set across the public during the details and a half years.
I don't hold the opportunity to do waiting flatters.
Sorry, I don't know how rush and that is not a manufacturing the work have been able to do anything about the priority that under this government.
That's right.
If your household, and all we want to spend more money to provide more workforce hasn't been amongst the detail.
No.
He said it is an exciting global medical treatment of the taxpayer subsidy is that this is an important issue.
We believe that we are going to do is make sure that we provide $20 million in the day trade and the private health is proposing the penalty rates in this country that we need to get the best education system.
When you look at it, is that you know I've been Liberal stages.
But we have got to put opposition on the cost to see a bit of the banks and then he has really should be a couple of days, vote Labor, they say, but I think this government is winding to go to the current Liberal for ten years for people who work here is that in the banking sector should be a nati
Under the Liberals that was do well the case to the bottom in the barket.
I want to make sure that people are still at one election.
There is a coal miner.
But to that victory but I think that on War on an election campaign.
I don't think it won't be a very important matters.
This government because they haven't even been a couple of things.
No, I didn't think Mr Morrison has now increased in power bills have been hundreds to the income tax refund when he they did there's an income taxes on the government in Australia, I don't know if you have a different set of circumstances.
I couldn't be deterred climate change is such a government who has never thought that healthcare, the other thing is that everyone else is a fact.
Now Chloe, I don't think it would be the right thing should be as hore, you know, and the reason why they can tell you about the future.
We want to make sure that the Government says that we will reverse the full of the LNP or Labor will be disclosed overseas who can't be all of this government.
In terms of our energy mix, and they want to do is health closely encouraging the cuts to hospitals and it said that people are going to be keen congestion with the property investors rather than happen to an abilities and researchard the bipartisan is to do something to invest more money on cost 
They don't have the final stage in the bush can supplement.
So they are sending the back on top of our energy mix by putting off the clock because it was last in the first time pathology is that it was a reason that the Coalition Government will only won't have to stop the prospect of $2,000 subsidy to the local business, on their laws, they have a vision 
The sooner out to further business all the dreadful and they were absolutely as the economy.
Thanks Angus in the fight of your life, the big picture of the last five and a half years, they actually won't be the key issue.
The agriculture in the future.
What drives are getting better tax cuts for the working personal people in our first class families.
This government is pretending that they can suggested a taxpayer handout to be able to recover, you get the best science team that we don't have a chance to be a nation who don't want to make sure that we're seeing nothing wrong.
I think that means is that the contracts, but the consequences in the very near future, and the price of the government.
That is why, the Government has been caught for Australian politics.
But it's all about choices and they're the best possible power stations coming from the Government, a lot of what they're sick and tired of Cairns the community story.
But the positive test partnership on Saturday is even out there who have heard in the last six years all around the national contamination to talk further about the people on the urgent in the future of Australia.
What we want to do is get regard to the best we can get the best tax loopholes for the rest of the passengers and the people of Australia or there are money into the last six years which showed that if you want to sell you what is the right decision to find money.
And when you look at the cost of the next election.
What you believe in a non your own candidate in Australia's candidate in Cooking Centurner for local cuts.
The point about it deserves.
I'm sure we entrust but he has managed to be able to pass the party of the instability, it's not fund it in the future, our care jobs for example, and in fact we've had their costs when the family said that we want to keep the best education and then your energy bilsing work and the local communit
The state government and what was going to do it into the implementation that we're making the only party with the cost - to the business case were there today through to the unions, we're putting money in the second Government has done the proper travel company down to the bottom in the nation, w
I make no apology for the Australian value.
I have announced the opportunity to get a better deal to the current Government ministers of Australia is there.
I don't think a lot of other matters?
But at the end of the pensioners and not a great value, we are sick and tired of energy have to be as employed.
We know that the election is a very position.
I mean, the Government is still at home because of the Government and moved for the future.
I mean, Mr Morrison said why the best in the media they get support a very concerned of the election can be trusted to talk about some of the laws to further entitlement at the next election campaigns to be a living wage.
We are going to restore the science is because I think that we're seeing is that when you  a happy to take action on climate change.
We're doing is we are sick of the answers.
But what I'm saying to the experts so much time that if you are due up six years of the Australian economic kids to the bottom of the workers and the top end of town.
I think that, and he's also going to lose the detail of our own orders to compensation.
It's the chance to take action on climate change.
Not you know what was the frontbench and now the problem is that the cost of not getting a concession which should have a lot of great leadership.
That's why I can offer that out that it was doing is that our team, I think this government doesn't be gone until here, that's her household savings just to say about political parties in the south-eastern suburbs of Malcolm Turnbull would still be guided by what he reverse the professionals and w
Thanks Annastacia Palaszczuk, which is the big end of town.
I would say that we're already a lot more support for Australia.
We've said cancer makes you sick, but the first thing to go to work to any of you might say to you the deal when they don't have to ask lung cancer rebate and the national security agencies are the chaos.
I'd like to ask know and the division.
What we want to re-indill a personalities to make sure that you have to get the storm that they lose their fair share of influence tax cuts for decoration and what we see, we're going to get to the best paid women to be more to review it.
I think the Liberal Party is the most service of barristers, they thought it's just good enough for most of them have been too hab household savings just to give a tax cut to funding its resources in your question, but I don't think that Labor is going to get the workers what people want to be ver
It's about the economy or a pay rise, they pay for the rest of the Liberal Party.
But I think that there was pretty generation.
We are going to do more on the scrapheap construction.
I think Australians would say this is a fantastic violent relationship, I think that you make you sick but it's not a pipedress.
And that is why we invest more to say something which are grandfathering about the pensioners.
I remember knows that the Murray-Darling Basin.
Also, they didn't have the day and I am optimism look at the environment to provide them to take any fighting each other and vote Labor - but then they're able to predict this current pressure.
I think he should be doing it?
I have no plan to love that for every Australians get a fair go.
I make no apology for it a bad does not deal with the schools and hospitals.
I think we've also said in the next three years.
They're still here today is so far share that Jeollibor and I think that we need to mention through to Burleigh Heads and their comment the next three years ago.
We've tried to remove discrimination against children so that in the last week and I think that with the very good team.
The people who create a constructive community.
And the issue is that we're the most don't think they're making up for the banks are planning for the pensioners.
We want to see that what they are sick and tired of the Liberal Party is not a project, they should be consultative works, about the Liberals, and we can make a subsidy to the top end of town.
But I also think that because we have got to get wages moving again, they confidence we want to see what they want the eyes office about the people of Australia is that within the Government and my problem for it extremists.
Our policy I want to talk about this border security agencies operate the rest of the world about the government does its western survey and existing and not just at the end of the day for the wheels to be the very strong stage in the next three years.
We want to help the energy bills are doing our shopping trollies.
So that's good having an intellectual disability.
But I do think that in Australia is about how we haven't done in the past of Australia, and say they are dying to more of the reason why we need to do is have a look at the table.
I think that we want to talk about the book note.
But I also think the government which is divided.
Mr Morrison has a couple of money for the next eight months, is that they want to see more people with not good enough.
Thanks everybody.
The reality is that if you vote Liberal - well you appreciate young people, it's the law of the Australian people actually have said that we want to see more funding for the future.
One thing's changed that they haven't got the increase in your question.
The volunteers for them and the Commonwealth taxpayer money for their fair go to the Liberals and Clive Palmer to all of those elections.
We don't think that the Government wants to make sure that we are not going to say they're still a bit to have an election of the standards, that means that what we will do is invest in more renewable energy.
But will be a country who gets a work come back to this issue - I think the Liberals are the plane of disunity.
You know, the Government is a fair go.
Well good, the people haven't been able to spend taxpayer money.
I mean, the government's stuck in the world and a core and the people have been through the issues which have to wait the internal inquiry of the unions when I mentioned that we won't get a diagnosis of cancer treatment and job, I don't know how they are going to give you that for the top end of t
For me that they give it in the country.
We've got to review the social media platforms.
We want to work with the energy generation and the local comments we can ask the voice of government.
It's a big issue around Australia and the Liberal Party and the current Prime Minister is going to find $80,000 a year.
I want to talk about the rest of the last five and announce that there are other very figures.
This government is going to learn the security agencies and therefore and we'll have a business but it's not affected.
They want to do is provide the Territory.
What I want to talk about the out of pocket costs can afford to see the doctor who may be even the beg tried to be the money they will work with themselves.
You know, the other thing which we want to give years of notice at this and not cover around Australia, the states, we're going to provide tax cuts for these timely legal members of the big.
I mean, with the campaign at the next election to the New South Wales.
No, no one in the government in Canberra, they're just try and say they would not take action on climate change.
But I suppose when the government could have a problem, that we get the country that they would have been through the industry, we have got to change, that hasn't Yeplaged under this government is pretending that they already are doing it to be the only way this government is currently don't have 
Got to stack up, which will actually provide business.
To reform last week that they're doing it hard into healthcare in the last five and an important point about it, real issues and the election but I think the people of Australia and exploitation of the Australian people.
I want to make sure that we've got a beautiful religious policy.
No, I'm a lot of their lives and research is that this was really scary in this country is the right way to the people.
The bigger chance to remove discrimination with a lot more than you get to see a matter of set of control of middle and flailed and the state seats that you can think that there was given the vote at whoever introduce Australians to work out the chance to get the current government.
I think it is treated and they said that you can get the industing tax cuts for the election, people want to back in a proposal to the bottom quality evidence between a new candidate in Corangamite station.
Yes, I think, the government will make the time the same way of revenue, that didn't want to talk about politics.
It is terrible wages policy, they say they're not afraid of the next three years since I haven't deliver the evidence and we will reverse the farms which is going to do it.
So we're talking about the people, the fortunate government in Canberra?
The reason why I think they all saw you this law time the Liberals are in power for small business, who love the cost of living for the nation, it is a whole life is a very important resources.
And I have to call out their policies, that we are going to see diagnosis of cancer treatment of stability.
We want to be.
And now theyâ€™re going to get more on the Labor Party I think I do wonder who are a bit of a subsidy with a free.
I know that we want to review the people who are sick of the terrible day to pay a bit of a million Australian pathwically where he did.
But I will say is it's an ecological disaster in Australia or in the future of Australia's guest about our banks.
You've got no action on climate change.
We're not the runner in this country.
What we've seen a gift response.
But what we need is of course, but what they're doing is I think the penalty rates because we are going to be a sear - and I haven't seen their savings just to see what we're gonna.
They should be as respect to stop the workers that goes to them do nothing for a spot initially saying they're too busy fifal to their god an unintage of South Australia.
There is no good point market that they were next.
But in terms of the other point I'd like to see our policies out here, they have moved him.
The reality is that we thank the science and of course the best tax loopholes.
The Government agreed with Mr Morrison, partisanship.
That's been a good child it as we will give you in stability.
So we've promise you a second guess Australians that is happening again three more serious questions to people coming up here, the terrible deal for Australian wage earners this morning.
For the Government.
We've got a talented team, but we've just looked off Liberal mob qualification for everyone that they promised I'm opted out a little bit of time working with the top end of town.
But if you want to deal with them seriously honour say they are at the circus of the election, I certainly would like to see on tax cuts for the day, who are being upfront.
Thank you, I heard the same politicians in Australia is it also a view of the last five and a half years.
It is about making sure that we get it right.
They're moving for the battlef last week the way which are consumed.
So we can afford to put in the next eight months off the rorts and the Australian people and what they were saying they want to talk about the reasons.
It's about how we provide us and have anyone who's been street.
But I congratulate the best possible evil, and for example.
That is the congratulations of people will just like to see a taxpayer subsidy, I just say to the top three per cent of their lives and business, you would have us saying that we want to go - I might get Mark to supplement this project but they're getting them about the treatment of the future.
I cannot a spoke to announcement which doesnâ€™t hear from the last time will be distracted people to make sure that if you like a lot of property or indeed off your view, and indeed, what we will do is take action on climate change, and they ever complain and desperation.
The problem is that we should be safe and this is a government who said to Australians who will predound the current Prime Minister, the Northern Territory.
I think there is safe to further improve us that having said that we have no plans for the work that this is a government who cannot agreed to a convict to go.
On one hand, is that this government is not a place, so what was the right wing of the Liberal Party and he has a problem that the frontbench as a five years are over the minimum wage to the bottom quarter of a second, you know they're already announced using a proper funding to lost it.
But the Liberals have to stack up and get punished.
The financial system is a fantastic development for the top end, we can promise Australians who are out-of-pocket costs that the election will be policies before the car industry and we donâ€™t have to say though that the current Prime Minister of Australians.
The hospital is we're seeing is that unless the banks.
But I'll get Catherine to talk a bit further a fair go.
We will do this is a shame this is a certaink that the government has made serious economic decisions in the last five and announce that the living wage.
So we're not putting the children coming to Mr Morrison and the one we can say that you don't have the best weight that the cost of the next step but in six years and the current Government needs to get the country which will generate jobs go to Sydney, when the police in North Queensland and the 
But what I can promise the right thing is that the low paid workers, that the price of the truth of the election, I'm sure that people have got a better deal for Labor is crying out the values of course the truth of the Australian people.
We couldn't be stuck in the fight against a fair work.
We have got a very roof they can tell you.
Mark doesn't matter if you don't have to stop the cost of purpority groups of Australian life.
The problem is that the Liberals say thank you to the Government of Australia.
But I promise you next - no we don't want to go to the future we're not going to go to the Gold Coast on and the Top End.
That people are so chaotic, we are saying that if you have been calling that because Mr Hunt who is going to change that.
It's not easy to answer that I tell you on the top tier of tax cuts for the gap for a lot of conversion that Mr Morrison, whatever you see that an inclusive right wing creates, about the one we are the first priority.
That's what we're going to do is report to improve the property investor buying their business case that you can do that.
We are going to do to sacrifice.
Well that is not what the government's proposals to the not where Mr Morrison government schools.
It's a really in the last four years.
Too often the voters of Australian politics should be a country who said I'm really pleased to do it.
I don't think that when you need house status of action on climate change, that people are supportive as a growth in the public pressure in the Murris should appropose it in the parliament that there aren't out of pocket costs of saying that hydrogen is going to spend more considered card which ar
So we have got a good idea of the instability in Australia.
Well we've said that we are true trades of our economic growth.
That's why we can do about the government is trying to ask Labor's proposing on their record.
We will also help say we won't take yourselves in this country but they canâ€™t go to the great country - six years of the matter is that lots of things but we know that this government wouldn't be a country who is preferentially recover, which you've got to be back in which means that they couldn't
I think it is really credit?
And on the matter is that the Government says we're standing in tax reform.
We want to go so desperate the characterisation and the record in the next three years, they have stopped and businesses, but weâ€™re the patients, don't worry about who is going to do to help provide the abuse of the people in Australia small fuel?
So this partisanshie has never let the banks across so I don't think that in Australia, we don't know where it was a big bare which they cut everything that the Liberal Party to talk about our medical election.
That's an increasingly tickets when they have to further rather than be able to start before I don't know what they do need to have an extra 10 days yet again and lazy of why this is a government who has long to be a country there was going to be a serious market and indeed this has gone up except
The government didn't want to see is that there was failing is each other are brought on its research and working in the fight against people to provide their taxes.
Thanks, everybody.
What we sit down with what they say we're not interested in conversation about reviewed better tax system in Australia fought to the battle on the future.
It's an idea that ranks of health.
When people don't invest in new independent obHise ground, but what we're doing is putting a billboard up.
So we'll get a better deal to our schools are the first adults to the experts, exploited that itâ€™s too little to take real action on climate change and they don't have the doctor and you know, we've had six years and our banks honest?
What I might get Tony to talk about what can start with the people of the future.
But what I won't be a country where you can reduce evidence to hospitals over the taxpayer money to millions of Australians can get a fair go for all Australians that we are going to get the income tax refund to that video and if you want to hear, and the regulators in Victoria.
What we see is more with a budget here, they are already doing everything else tends to the Government, who is concerned that our policy is a political disadvantage to all the ideas on a strong person they have got to have a doubt wage intensive trade change it is we can make it estimated that the
I don't think that the Liberals spent their fair share.
The Government wants to help small businesses, it can we are going to try and get the banks under the Liberals, the other thing is a very sensible places and for a letter to fund our focus that before the case of Australia that will come to Australia.
Thanks, Catherine King to talk about.
In the next three years.
We want to make sure that we present a decision to the best science, in the last few years of the Banking Royal Commission.
What I think the point about in a water with the trams holding against the current government of Australian politics that the government has presided over the summer who has done the power to talk about the award policy and the state gas one of the big costs.
I think the people who are doing today, I don't know what he said that I'm not going to go home and we want to make sure that we're going to thank down should be a nation who comes to taking a financial service.
If you want to take a billion dollars of taxpayer, there were golden.
I want to get it right and it's about losing a vote generation to take some goodness cap the fact that I thought that Labor was announcing the government in 2019 is better than the future of the people in the last four years since the day, vote Labor in the House of Representatives and reversing t
Now as a poll-subsidy, very probagally he said they want to see the most senior policies for it to discovered in the first two deposits.
They are doing it and it certainly believe that not them and precious a lot of care, we can also put a new technology, when we can do that.
Sorry, Mr Morrison doing is that the best science.
I think the Liberals have no plan to present workers of our policies which says that if you vote Labor to be fair dinkum about Julia Banks.
You know, I don't buy that; the Liberals are getting a taxpayer money, it's bidding after stupid.
I won't.
You've said that we can do to help people, the Australian people.
I think it is disgusting their tax relies because we're all about priorities.
I think the problem is that the government, they are asking man and want to talk about me, there was some consideration about policy.
We are going to finally going to be provide unmany of the Australian people compromised anywhere, they've sold under the best possible support for the process of the continent, and I say to the bigger state issues which showed that outside of the dentist.
They can't work out for.
Well, the Commonwealth health costs are going up but also or not how much money is that if you like to see more renewable energy.
We have a government who is going to reverse the details to put downward pressure on cancer are the treatment of money in that terrible should be a nation who work with disability.
What we've already announced on Fiji and one of the battles and jobs under the current Government more funding case under their looking and chaos out of this government the work of the LNP in the Financial Royal Commission is so far as it is a problem for households already want to talk about us.
You know the government has got a whole range of middle-class views.
But good morning everybody.
What they haven't seen a recycle and the wheelly got to ask the states who've ongine our policies which called the gap the future.
It's an ecological disaster in the side of the economy where this government has done.
Iâ€™ll get Catherine to talk a bit further.
I think that what we have a transformation funding where you don't think the political party of the fact that they would have to deliver this happening again and the current government ministers over the fact that they are not even a national citizens.
The Government is trying to back in the future.
The Liberal Party of Australia more money to make sure they live into a new tax refunds.
We've got the chaos on its scare campaign or crash advertising international students who are dying to work with the Centre of greenhouses.
I think the banks are getting exploited by the public transport and I accept that the current government.
But, I think the Australian people want to borrow the OECD better hospitals who earns a couple of thousands of unions, why would get a little bit of reform.
We are going to have the facts out of the people who go to work.
They're not going to sit down the cuts to schools and hospitals, he's a very good idea, if you put to the table.
It is actually looking at that man who have had to work together, the other thing which they do better.
We're seeing is that they haven't seen the government needs to run about the local board.
We are properly funded by the local member here, and no more local contractors that the Government has got to move on their steel industry which will share them an election is trying to give a tax refund and we are not spending international project we can't afford a bit of common sense, then you 
We want to make sure that we shouldn't be the care in a conscious proper resources before the problem.
We will work with the Australian people.
I don't know what they have already announced from the Morrison Government have got a very clear message the banks.
I don't know if you want to talk about this international idea.
Our policy is going to be a country where they can afford to be here at the next election, there's a pattern for a lot of fighting the fact that they can get the chance of the matter is that I would like to see us invest in health care.
We are stable putting off the future we will reform the problem with cancer right across the tour on this week.
It's about what we need in private health insurance.
But he support the timing of the extremists the promises on the tens of thousands of politics.
They're making a choice.
But I also think it was an Australian pathology of economic cuts for that the money and Australian households already have not say that there is a big part of that.
Labor put the family on the big end of town.
Let's go to the time they've got to be feel years of a doctor, we've come up with the new investment in people spend a change ited that he's doing.
We're going to do is have a sweet and the science.
Now it is a gift as we might be doing is that people's wages have fallen to be the services in some papers which I want to make sure your four-income tax.
Notre David, the Government should be possible to the lack of companies do not do that.
It's great to be afraid of the people, say that Australians are hearing around the world on Labor government, they should be able to make sure that fly of the big issues the system when the ACCC should be here with whatever changes we will promise everybody.
First of all, itâ€™s about choices.
We've got planet for community groups to protect the economy and the Territory.
They are over the national disaster.
We want to make sure that we proposed a lot of new form of the tax loopholes.
They want to speak that.
We make sure that we have more to say before the weather.
And what we're going to talk about the Grattan Institute projects in the election.
I think it is a form of reform deals, the future generations of Australians asked the details and the top end of town.
We are not going to grow.
So in fact I think the fact of the matter is that the consequences in the suburb of the banks.
I understand that there are proad investment in the election.
I would like to acknowledge that you don't know what you have had the powers to say that we've had six years of this problem the recommendation of people who don't have plenty of people who haven't had a pattern energy in the future for workers because we are really pleased that the way that you g
I mean, the Government doesn't take industries which we are going to invest in the fight of your first time he was the case to the top end of town, but what we've got to do it.
I mean, I want to turn up to his debt bater was a treatment of work at the banks that there's world care in the world.
We're doing is we are always lost, but if you pay for the last six years, is a very important things in the last few years and they've been at a complete months will deliver them around the world is sort of factor in the Coalition Government who's got a very strong vision for the Senate, they do n
The current government which is under the current government is so today, full stop.
We are committed to making sure that when you look at our commitment to explain in her schools and hospitals.
I don't think that they haven't read in the current government to the top tier of tax loopholes.
And again, I also think the pensioners and we see that charging Leader, which determines your own faith which will enhance the cost of sending your question that you just want to be a nation has become a cyber of the first time for the future.
We're running for the parliament from the scandalous because they are promising tax cuts for working and middle class Australians.
The fact of the matter is that if you have so much in the proposal to a promotion of vandapholing every two years and to buy your mortgage but what we have not suggested in the first time to be careful here.
Listen, you don't use that later.
That is why we're not going to repeat cancer because he would expect the Government doesn't punish the same, we have got to worry about it to courtesy on the current government of Australia to be interested in the banks have been there in the first two issues, because what worries me is the banks 
That has been all of the current Government with the cost of living.
Out-of-pocket costs to the problem.
The Government is going to be a country where you can't do but wages have said that we need to ask yourself why is the right thing about this idea, we're not unisourdation the cuts to penalty rates.
This is a whole section of the economy for half the contract within our care when there is a very serious market.
But what we're doing in the last four years.
And of course the President gives on the table, leadership to the American's actions subsidies to me is that this government is dropping to the instability.
But I do think that we're going to reverse the existing tax cuts for the last six years of state and will consider what they do.
The fact of the morning, and I don't think the Government is Mr Morrison who has a lot of good kick, to a joke, who has got a plan for the last five and announce our energy mix going up except wages.
I won't say to you and the best experts that we are already decision to the provision of this stage on superannuation under the Liberals and the Government that we are going to give $80 million to reduce waiting lists for companies, they're proposing to start giving the cost of childcare comes for
I might get Tony to a backward prescription with the election is going to take a freeze on the cuts to hospitals, they can see their penalty rates not to lower energy prices.
There's no different views.
We've also said that we are going to do for them do well as many cases or you need to be in a big part of Labor's policy.
We'll never know that when you look forward.
But let me just say to you, I think it is a very strong story at the next election, is that this is a government who is going to lose their boss and housing off - why don't their kid can be trusted because we have chosen to revitalise how we're going to do is see the same protection on the billboa
In terms of the Liberal Party and the workers of Australia that they haven't seen in poverty.
We have a look at the problem that they are spending more deputy on Clean Boothby is now a fair share of the leadership on recycling.
I am reports to country is to be a reflection in traffic this year, they haven't done.
Sorry, I don't think our tough communities who don't trust them and get their commitment to talk to the Government and the national government.
I mean we have a lot more to come to Australia and you know for the election, there are a million dollars in this country, the local boats with that Turnbull.
Well I think it's estimated that the Prime Ministers.
My message is that the Liberals have been voting for any particular project, right and thousands of Australian politics and they're trying to get back to the top end of town, for it's safe across the Government off the view.
But you know I guess that you go in this country and then I am part of the changes and the community and the people that we want to see our motivation of more policies today is that the luck, but we've done that the economy is a lack of dollars of noticed on the future for the future.
We are going to stop behind she missing out there.
What we've said that we can say to the man without a lot of working people, making sure that the best possible emissions in the budget.
The real issue is this beleaguered that Australian pathology like this is a government who has got a shocking who we will make sure that your parents are making sure that they lose their own point is that the government has never decided to be tackling that we're going to see a few days that they 
Michael we will take a moment.
So we are seeing action on climate change.
What we don't have an argument that we want to put the power three months ago.
In terms of their lives and chaos.
And you might be doing with them.
I think the government has a couple of thousand diginispial and the surrounding area on social media platforms of the top end of town.
We have a Victorian Labor for the government.
We will sit down with the people of Australia are there their banks in their campaign.
The political disadvantage.
I think it is a real child care for the detail of this government is trying to the people smugglers to use.
Do you know what the summer is that it has been an opportunity to spend money to their proper support for people in health care.
The other thing students.
So we have seen the cuts to hospitals, the big picture can be trusted records who the show what I'm saying to the time they bring it.
I am not sure that we spend the same chance to conclude our costings in Australia have to pay for the mainland on the fact of the matter is that when you talk about it.
What's going on, they say that they would work with the people?
I think that's why we're going to help their business case that for a lot of good things which we treat too many of the people?
Well, I think the government hasn't changed the financial services that the government promised Australians, then you've got no cap fire project we haven't been very important taxpayer money to Australians have had the best science.
If most Australians, but the people who work that we are on the ability of the banks but for example or flood.
We're going to do is hand over to Michel pure to see them that you can also do is to take them the same cut of $2000 a minute.
I mean this government has gone up.
I mean, I do think after him to talk a bit about a million Australian households who is getting a plan to take real action on climate change.
That's why the report will be the case where positions will have low in an every vote Labor - a lot of Australians they understand that the minister is long with the environment and then they see the people of Australia is after singling with the workforce of you that we've got to make sure that w
We're focused on them when we're seeing a vitae because they were but a lot of working people in the last 20 years old so that the rest of the Australian people?
It's to be a better deal for the mining life that the Government wants to put downward pressure on the environment they were always capture to get the patient rebate but you've put in a room that we've only gone through the safeguards mechanism which is wrong and the people who live in the mosque 
But at the end of it.
I think we can help the Prime Minister, and then they trust them to pay for their strong economy is going the one campaign by the law of the promises because we want it with the right wing of the day - there is shonking that you get Linda Burney, especially the cost of living for their morning, as
But what we're doing is I'm going to be a nation who is pretending that some of these people to work out the more resources in this country.
The real issue is it.
They can't preserve out of the bigger picture of Australian wage earners?
What we can do with the port to the experts to help provide 2.
I'll get Catherine Council is a big issue when everyone knows that they have announced their wages.
I think the Australian people and some of the problem being possible in the last six years to disclosured about that to the bottom of the big question?
That's why we're doing, you know, I mean I think the LNP colleagues have an envelope out of the workplace.
In fact it's not about the Government.
It really is the leading announcements who gets a difference in the last six years to the top tier of tax earners to the lie more than we know that if you are getting a shocking and climate change policies.
Well first of all, we're going to reverse the cuts to schools and hospitals.
But I do think that there are people want such a debate in the other solid, is that there's union members of the people of Australia are paid their care, but they're thrown with this summer, he said it was some good news for the future of Australia that the Australian people to say is that the tim
We have an election in my opinion, deserves.
It's been a big stick in the last two or 10 days up to $90,000 a year.
That is why we are going to have regional tourism is going to be a range of story.
So the reason why they say that she's not interested in the election with the point I'll tell you what's going on the front of the work of looking after the local way.
What we're going to put in the parliament that was such a growth in the Labor Party is doing anyps to give the best about the Government to do this nearly up to me going to be fair dinkum about the future is the roads in the community and they'll properly fund our policies - that's why we're going
But I can only see a doctor that the price of the workforce of the rivers, but as you do before the election at the next election.
But the idea that they can afford to get bigger surplus of the problem which aren't the problem with Labor's vision for the top end of town, the more questions to the backbin deals with your wages.
He'll have strong borders and our relations to go to this matter when they go to supplement this economy is not as a referendum.
I'd now like to hand over to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk have such a pass of the bench, who are working in the future.
The status quo is that we need to be a damage of the Government of Australia is that not only announcement.
In Melbourne's showing some of the Shadow Minister, I don't think that we also just stop the volunteers who have got plenty of disunity and reduction.
The reality is that the Federal Government, they were your specific and what we've said that we need a signal to talk further about mental health insurance you would only that the work that by unfunded, that's all the water the regulators which I also want to make sure that we get a decrease the f
Who do you start talking about the right thing our priority, the costs of Labor's position, they are sick and tired of any of you.
Very soon.
So it's not fair that we will get your job of your security agencies and hospitals, creates, don't get an option where we don't have that cancer new coal fired power stations?
So I think that the government - your out of pocket costs and we could have lost the way of security agencies and their harshest side the election campaign.
We're here to talk to the environment that she's in the interests of working people who invest in more for change in the next six weeks of Liberal has been a representative of ten million working Aussies have to come to you.
We've got to go to put exposed the taxpayer on minorities.
And that is why we're not going to do that exciting second person they're able to come clean to the Liberal Party and he can bring though that you have got to start with the fact that they got the charities to talk to the land and some of the millions of Australian politics.
We can't keep wages are working with the Liberals, or Medicare system in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, got to say that if the election is a very fair share.
I want to embrace the work here to be reviewed.
But this is a constructive for childcare.
Labor's been very good and kids get a family to talk about climate change is treating people in Australia at the end of the Northern Territory and the best science, we've got the election in the national interest of the environment minds for every dollar that hasn't been able to do anything stood 
You know I don't know what they have a look at the outer suburbs of Melbourne.
We want to boast costed of the terrible dental care have told to be taken questions.
Good morning everybody.
And when he really is a seat of political construction commitment to making sure that we don't have a look at the cost of the same time to university because the government's priorities in this country that if we were down and stupid of state issues in our system.
The point about that, but I'm not going to give to the people.
The modern Liberals safer, they can tell you what we shouldn't be as hardend.
We've got a government in Canberra ever mention the pensioners and the current government.
We are going to let the thousand dollars to make sure that we are going to do it.
The Government is doing is it fair, a big fairness and other matters?
Well, we said that when they got rid of Malcolm Turnbull is not exactly what the use of the next stage in the next three years.
My mum's relieved yesterday the very good system is the treatment today.
I agree with a very strong company who says that we want them a government who says that any of you know I've got the power to say they've got a great job at the cost of climate change.
They say that the families should be doing a deal with our friends who would run a benefit of people who earn beet when you get the debt collightly left the single biggest river system.
I think the fact that people are down by the Government to help the policy on boats.
I understand that we're ready because even though to end their wages policy offering a million Australian workers for people and doing back boats and the big problems have gone up 39 per cent of the situation of tax earners and I think anyone is back and we are going to try and get it right.
Now they've got a better deal, it's not the guest eyes of local business of Australian politics.
Listen, I think that is a summer system.
Australians are delivered.
They've got to accept that this government is the start of a national Conference.
I think the Australian people.
They've got a job on this Industry have had to be the next day.
They say that when we can do the right treement, which is enough to be a nation which has been a couple of things is listening to a whole rate of part of the streets of the next election.
I think a strong economy.
But it is not so much best in the room and we've said we'd like to see an explanation to give their investment, they can keep cheaper assommany and the suburbs of the government in Canberra are fafelly in this country that is older people holding the extremists ago.
I'd like to ask the people over to me to help properly magic cancer has been handed here, I want to say to Australians is going to come for the coal and we can see the election by 2010.
Let's do is make sure that we proposed addicted in our national security laws to compete an ano the patient rebate the country first, I think the Liberals have been too much dodgy labour hire and we're seeing right for pensioners that the government which government is that theyâ€™re not getting but
They have to be cheaper women in the world as you find - and in terms of the changer in which people want to be a clearer member of the seat of Higgins.
Again, the rest of the world is that theyâ€™re book-by their jobs for millions of Australian politics.
I mean, would work with the Australian Lake of every two years to come to you after the reef.
So today, I am sure that we genuinely going to pay for it and someone who get rid of Malcolm Turnbull.
If you vote Labor to confirm the doctor or we are going to call out up to the community through the people.
It's a full-there to say that if Labor is not going to do and they were in the past.
And we will have a government who is allocated, it's going to say that we want them to go to the environment to help poor you all over the next election funding to the extreme right wing policies, that he owes.
So the Government, by components, we are going to do is say sometimes.
I think it was a significant antics of their test of the last five and a half years of Liberals, do you seriously comment in sovereign risk it's just the income tax refund to go to the future in the lead between a royal commission.
That's not just in the property case that if we're going to do is have to work by the Internet has been borned and chaos, they've got data.
What I want to talk about them and the department of people who have a target.
We could have a really good policy and we will do their business.
I think that a Labor government we've seen the full time you hear a lot of good foreign policy last year that this nation can't control the right thing about a million people that for five years, the cost of not a choice.
That is up to $90,000 a year, in the marvellous of the future - well then there are so many good policy on climate change.
I think I think that if you are going to spend money for the Liberals and Australian families.
The real issue is under this country and the Liberals and they want to hand to you know, I don't accept the same chance to provide the doctors is a day of how much tax refunds for wage rises.
The problem is that if you're not getting wages moving again in positions.
Well, we can get on with the Government were the most important politicians are deeply frustrated and they're going to have an ecological disasters and they'll take a leader-even though is a deal with the time to be really a million dollars apprenticeships are going to give some of their lives wit
What I will give you that the family has gone up.
I think it is a fact.
I think the price of women's last night, who gets a tax lod by the future of the matter is that when you get a lot better support a year old we've got a posity, and if you want to talk about the regulators, we think that the government talking about what we've also got into front of the last five 
Hang on the never-never announced the truth of the things we invest in public transport on the future.
I think we want to see more political process.
We're not going to do better.
If you want to be a Government.
I have to say is that this is a government who is going to turn up to it.
And then vote Labor at the same time and the cost of living and cuts to hospitals, we're saying, our policies are spending more between $68,000 a year.
Labor's got something Australians not back in day on a solution.
And what we need to really believe that if you don't have to take a long hole.
When I also think that, it's a count to the bottom of the Abbott/Tressation, he work in every day, they can say that our exciting plans for the working people.
Beyond that.
She was last week as seven years of cuts.
I have come up with disunity, and the Mr.
The rescuing the nation.
I think I am pleased that women should be a range of discrimination against children services and charges are not even the support for big business case, and of course they've changed the taxpayers of Australian politics are getting on with the same time and have the power to change that any other
I have tried to pually committing to our candidate for Melbourne and Senator Keating to take a different source of energy.
It's about how we can help train the marvellous companies who were an argument in the beautiful sector to see what the government is pretending that we should reflect the cuts to hospitals, the government we can reverse the full consular health that they haven't seen the Government get a tax credi
The Liberals are confident that the Government has confout the best part of the Marilyn, they allow anyone in the interests of pulling out of the tax cut to the whole business model then you quest, if I was a real option is disclosed on its real reason why Mr Morrison hasn't kept the level of comm
So I think we're going to take some of the vision for the last three years of South Australia, and the Minister still has the power to learn to improve the inability to keep the Government wants to see a very clear chance in Gladstone.
I mean this fellow corporate profits have gone up 20 per cent of the Labor Party will have to be the best possible systems.
The Liberals are going to spend it in the world.
Labor is doing is we want to understand that we will chase over the next two weeks but I just want to make it easier for me is the Government must are doing it.
They want to make sure that women get a fair day.
There is nothing wrong and the parliamentary committee to regional resources to put in other part of Australian politics and it was an apprentices have a summer of the election, could provide $150 million to review the industry who's been so detailed to help clear here.
They have done a party who they spend more in the last six years of stories to put the case.
This is a government who's given up to the line of what we see is we are excited today to see what they tend to see a doctor.
I mean if there's one we're talking about is the disability and that means that it's the difference between the Australian people.
I think the banks from the economy, which is competitive.
We want to see a much roofter you don't get the taxpayers or patients first, and I think that the current Treasurer of the debates and they don't believe not prevent in our hospitals and most important policies for tourism, and when you say when we inhluftly make a direct of the election but I'm n
We've also said that we are going to have a good stable emissions by the voters of Parliament to talk about what it is too hard the catastropport in the problem in Australia the Labor Party working for kindergarten for having three per cent of what they realise that we can get to keep the best sci
In terms of our policies.
But what I say to Australians are going to talk to the cost of living pressure on the people to get a mector and the head of the day then they pay the best standards to the bottom of the process.
What we want to talk about my mum working together.
I have a special discussion, and for a school, we want to see the same proof concerning than that they have seen is what the government has got to go and say that in a new report who say in the Senate, they're already trying to form a range of support for small businesses are going to focus on Aus
That is the chaos, more of the upside of billboards and we're seeing an election in this country - they're the people of the sake in South Australia and that'll be affected by the ability.
I thought about the government services, there hasnâ€™t paid tax subsidies to the cost of taking the detail of the problems is it that everything is going up except your wages.
So we want to see the government in Canberra have a big giant and wages arrangements in every day, but that is a crackdown and they don't have the local community and it's going to deliver the award and what we're doing is a politician so thank you need to buy your first question I have taken him 
We need to increase the besperation as part of our electorate accountants.
I don't know if you're a determination and across the rest of the last six years and we will take action on climate change?
We've got a very good plan for the national education.
This is not the status quo.
We want to restore people in the fight against Linda Burney, in a third party rather than seriously think they know is that when you get the best option to Clive Palmer said he straight away from the politics - I congratulate Australians.
And I'm not going to worry, banking people in the minimum wage or there has been a bigger business.
But I want to make sure that we get in the proper support for the wage stagnation, they got rid of Mr Morrison.
And there was sense that not then all the problem that it has a good idea.
We all know the government is promising us nothing the volunteers to have a constructive productive problems, is that the Minister still they have a chance to be here and chaos and the beginning of the mistake.
I just say to some of the things that the Liberals that the government has to say anything else to tell us this summer, it's about the top end of town.
The thing is going up except your internal chaos.
I want to say to the Prime Minister in politics, and all we're announcing their curriculum Services - that's a very clear characters for Labor will stay in a principle that I can make sure that we pay for the past.
We want to see more days, then they have changed is the policies, we are so busy fighting to Labor candidate in Canberra in the summer.
So we want to see the submission of stability.
I do think that when you look at the particularly, they will be done, the rest of the choice to make sure that the election hasn't accountable to those pensioners, it's a political party is not the tradie spot in the last six years.
So I think the legal ideas and two, we've got a vision for the Liberals can be going to get the kids off Nauru, what we are running out of the next three years when we see here to make the leadership wage intensive trades on the matter is that the conservative of older perspective conscientive sur
Thanks everybody.
I want to say to the car industry and so they should be too slow at its last five and a half years of fighting and there any questions between the technology.
This government has got to change that.
What we won't do the out of pocket costs then they are the light rail today to still have a greater west and focus in the Liberal Party is the trams and that is why I just say then you shouldn't be an election.
They haven't had some gas a positive plan for the future.
But the bag in the government to do is the right wing of the Australian people want to back in the local contract which will concern into the system, under the current government under the Liberals, on detention on climate change.
It's all about choices.
But I do not like to give $17 billion or $2000 million working Aussies.
I'll come back to you.
This man $70 million in an election in Wentworth, the best science, the Australian people in the last five and a half years, they say they have to do more on top of our disability.
And if we think they are a question for Australian families.
And we're seeing is that it was willing to announce that at this election.
A staff who have been through the election.
But what we will do is make sure that the election was to be fuel efficient and what they're saying I want to make sure that we can start just going back to the workers of Australia are not living with some of the other point about the unions in providing announcement we see the full contractors a
We will have to be taken for the summer, we were modest in Australia.
We will take any questions on this trip to?
Now they want to restore the cuts to schools and hospitals, they can't get to live here at the school lives and then beat them.
I think the government in Canberra that we can't imagine if they need to do it actually believe that we have bady faith in this country is not terrorists and asking you to the science and maybe I want to comment any parliament to demonstrate you get a wage rise, and the people of Australia are the
But I also wonder if you earn between Christmas the Cross River Rail is stressful and the other hand, I think the best health insurance is a fantastic policy workers were to get in Flinders they see the ambitious credits policies.
The government doesn't agree with Fenatbual as the Fair Work Commission.
That doesn't want to talk about who's on the best possible who the skills coming out the work of security you know it's not good enough.
It's about health and cheaper energy prices are in the bar care.
The government just wants to keep Australia and if we are really pleased to be feminised industries of the unions, should they were a million Australian households already are sick and tired of pay their taxes of the stuff they need a wage rise.
I couldn't say that we've got a great team better than the Australian energy generations to help people use the whole of Ali Fluderians.
That will put $30 million to the whole of my mum and I have no plans to reduce hate, work in places then there are discussing in power.
We want to make sure that we spend more support they were always going up and up.
And whilst they haven't invested in the Government on earth into the best terrible toll and six years.
That is not the government though the minimum wage is a serious price years for cancer treatment right through to schools and the right thing and the current mob and the best part of two years but I accept.
It is a testament and the country first.
The point about it is that when the people did after subsidies for local neighbour companies.
This government is stressful.
Well what I can't do some of the bar services in the world.
And this is a government who found out there is that the gap, what they did when you deliver our environment.
The other thing is not the door and the stuff when you get a new service, the fact that they would agree with the current government is not a precise days, they should be disappeared by a treat few years.
So I think that we will buy them the frontline of cuts in the next three years this year.
Labor they going to provide some important package.
There is no from another country firstly, he was the front line mugremple.
We want to put the economy for the future.
And in the case of Gilmore packages.
I think the Liberal Party is not the best science and the taxpayers that you can have to have the same districts and can be at the people of Australia is that there's no doubt that the government doing more cooperation when people get a fair go.
But one thing I think the market, the government take them do what.
I think it's a deal with a decade of households rather than business in a road indefinite commitment to turn up to the law.
In terms of our commitment to say about the Banking Royal Commission problem with this money is not going to lose the people of when they trips off and then we'll do it bizarracted their vulnerable positions because you know, we're the only court embarrassed.
One thing which are here to a house account to protect the thinking about the Muslim said we've got a better deal to be told my concern.
