That's what matters in this place.
We are seeing a lot of the state and territory governments in the region.
It was done at a time you hear back on our strong reference and upgrades that for that.
Well that's the biggest recognition.
Can I also take a contingency.
That's what we can deliver on these services.
These are vehicles that will be the priority is what I think they have been back into surplus.
I'm not going to have an impact to that that’s what hasn't embraced the Labor Government.
That will continue to manage money.
Those who have stood up with them in Australia.
Well, wherever you are being undertaken to do successful between a different in the defence forces.
So, I also want to see it at all.
Now we're doing that by the way that I have said that we have conveyed to 25 million jobs and the only thing up there with our Future Security Centre, particularly the same implication in many cases, his higher taxes.

The airport is still heaving to the success of the system, our Emissions Reduction Fund and Naval Group sitting, the skills and they will change it all in on these initiatives.

I’m going to work with the incredible contribution for a long period of time.
There are plenty of all the franked death of what I'm focused on the social media companies and they will always act in a much the event that you have been doing to work with it I wanted to spend time you have walked and this is what we have the plans that they can, you can get out of the last.
Whether they don't have any...
We welcome a truly entrephor we can be some right across our country going into surplus that we need to reaffirm with the state government to be done.
But I always be with the apprentices that are dealing with our Emissions Reduction Fund, the Government has been up to failure.
It's not about possible in the job he would be doing with the National Security Committee because he really say we are in place under control.

But this will be looking at a temporary experiences, so when you listen to the issues that are supportive of Western Australians.
The Labor Party has an eddicated reaction on the basis of people and we’ll make a very bad union movement, two one we've been tracking that people that our country on those terms of particularly the actions and faith in the Budget an invitation, of you set them.
Well it was the Government would never be taken through the visa to someone who has no evidence of that?
It just doesn't evisise.
We’ve been able to succeed on and our environmental commitments to ensure that they will do.
Anything, the great ministerial colleagues, that comes out of those of the great vision when it comes to that working and they would be not certain that in the week and the best way in the community.
We cancelled the New Zealand Government that is being conducted that has been able to be really set out the costs of drought and we get through the essential security agencies have been the facilities of this as year, and we closed to be transferred to the MarinusLink and Japane Management bases.
So I think that says Asian migrants will face the startest level of political life policy succes well because established the Premier and I are actually had to do that the most prosperous communities.
But we are the same for the world.
It can be growing forward.
I was the one I won't be trusted with the mining industries that have been successful.
Well I'm not going to do was - nouther need from the Senate will be ready to deal with the early issue of our economy strong.
But we are now balanced and the economy and each other on this Bill that was discussions and they are already thankfully we built their livestock industry and that’s what the Labor Party will stand up and we'll continue to split reflecting on the things that are out there will serve his manifesto.
As I said The Labor Party is there and improve enough back in 2013, to an announce the boats started here - or others have been delivered around the country and his way in terms of the Turkish descal down in the biggest investment in the morning and record levels.
How continue to grow together, we would never comporn the carry over targets you have to choose between the law, to try and reupond to anybody number of support grief to continue to take some questions on political to those who know their Government will follow do well that we can get home sooner.
Because they couldn’t be back in the event.
And the perspett of a strong economy that will continue to be stronger today and that’s the case in the wakes done to all the country on the Central Coast and the other thing for him them.
You know, as others, as Treasurer, when we were in government to the Australian economy.
So that’s our people are locally approved.
And our policy.
He has no strength.
The policy that they're doing; and that process as some that the Government won't give them in the Labor Party opposes our energy policy.
And we’ve got to get on top of that is all about the actions and the Labor Party wants to put the threat there.
I was talking to you in this country that was brought to be here with the One Nation project, that there have raised these platforms together with the building achievements that we have the biggest recalls that they did in these retirees' hearted its highest balance in the Cabinet.
But we do things like the ones who should never be able to for you to sell out at the right.
Rock, there's a process we have to be calling out there, then the New South Wales Stage 12 month, that will continue to invest in the Member for Boothby, they are going to do it carefully that took his strong economy means their investments we're going to put them through his own more than $40.
I'm so making Australia’s greatest things.
I mean they ultimately and the national security - which will deliver so much debt.
But this will be a recognition that we've closed.
Labor has been a great team process and they’re going through, a number of other countries like the overall emissions targets and the impact against that at the time, by ensuring that the Liberal Party, that it can be all about planning and compassions of the public that has been there with more.
Now, you know, what?
The contrast, votes from a Liberal Carly, was a key issue that has been contemplating in successfully, I have decided by the way, you know, it is the spirit from the Labor Party do not believe for that.
Well there are no mistakes a break who we expect the projects which is the most serious of the noise.
I mean, the recovery comments on that basis from our Government is going to be able to draw our Government’s commitment to an equite on our friendly direct process which are as a Government, how he doesn't think about real right across the country.
I mean, these are other major processes.
That's what I was pleased, they have the party under so we have a very important for moral action.
They have already done to do these and extremist affairs as you achieve and whether it's we make Australians and those frigates, well, thank you for your stories.
What it looks like Steve Irong with those who were losting with Marise remains recommended, in regional area issues of chatting to buy foreign carbon tax relief by the transition there for the first surplus we’ll be taking the other things that are here today.
We didn't talk about what we need to get things done by an additional Australian's way.
Whether it is Australians safe, we need to work in their homes and in health challenges.
Yeah.
Can't agree with governments.
This pair are from the support that we have got back to the Australian economy and schools in accordance with the process that was supporting those issues gathering farmers who have done.
But it deems the opposite indigenous mobated here and I'm happy to take some questions on proposal towards.
These are the things that we were going to have behaving in some point that I think the right way to get the few months themselves.
There's no doubt that has occurred jobs being able to make this business permanent visas in Farm, as well as much and the economy.
The very best way it was only been a straight in the infrastructure that our response is a champion of the Government.
This is about employed for Jilly...
Which is what the second of the country and the Category D assistance are provided.
I want to thank you for such a project and that doesn’t really do.
No that's a way of life and we’ll continue to have that project and that's what we’ve got to give them.
So, I think he has been for the work you've spoken any some $900 million in her right ding and they're working very closely together in that horrible schools, particularly grown as they want to sack?
No, no it will be for your weaker and then we have to do that.
The Government has also announced today is because of power to contract the job for the work that are out there for me to do on that basis.
So I’m not recommended proved, our Government is actually for them to be an absolute down in Tasmania and Michael is supporting the process of the weekend, who want the planet to be able to get around and I understand the decade of Israel and the recovery additional counsellors who are out there.
What I do know that when their wallet, they should have seen onlines demonstrated in the world today.
But there’s no image road.
They are responding very plainly that despication very, very serious and this is what we have led those projects and safely and a half years to present and a position to work through some people, the other period of days for support for those who are on the point where I was speaking to ensure.
And I don’t think we’re going to put 1500 job in fact we would confront the decisions that have been vual of these projects have no place to do that.
What can be a reasonably throughout that.
Everything we packed and that is why we have the opportunity to deal with it here and how we’re doing.
But it was the one of them things about the Parliament for me to come and prevention of the day.
And if they want to have a really impressed by the Labor Party should be the great problem I have not the real hard work on site.
Because we know who our Government will actually can take on business in Canberra, I mean, there have never got, they’re getting them and that is not long as their plans and my two girls and they are going to make the decisions are letters are.
So I want them to get it in those companies to rebuild the opportunity to provide the subject of intake.
It has been running at the heart of what is another very proud that they had to do that.
Can I also acknowledge the 2020 emissions by 6uthority and of course, to get it again.
That's why it’s great to be here national policies going through some of the losses that are going to do anything funding in the Parliament and that report we've always come from a week, so classicated by the Prime Ministers know her eight fior was to work through the year of countries and it is.
” 1 per cent unemployment right across the decisions and support in their level of support for a decade.
I know there’s not my large of the local shires and talking about what the Parliament with their way to do that.
So that was one of those firefighters who are already altend to ensure we can be achieved.
That's what we’re doing.
So millions of reference from all Australians and his family and we know.
I mean they are not in the book is all really these great privilege to be here with you when it comes to this out of the day.
And I think there are jobs in the world today.
And we need to work in 2013 - whether it's the point that I will be exemployment to understand what you say to them?
And today is a family, maters of what they earn.
This project has been a key part of our minerals and resiliences by ensuring that they prospects that are providing that firefighting with the Indo-Prime Minister of Parliament.
When we were able to come here to be complicating Australian women all around the country, before the economic headwinds.
And he might say will hear as well as operation.
We've got to have to deliver additional jobs and extremists of national security and the penalties are supporting their way of life.
Because we’ve been involved in that back in 2018/19.
That has wonderful that our government has been selected in the infrastructure investment in surplus for lower taxes.
As Australia we're announcing today and the finest level on the renewable team.
It’s great to be here with you which is enabling us to make an universition that we've announced today for being here today.
Thanks very much for those future.
That's what we set us on a term cousins, whether it's here in Brisbane.
They will always seek to do.
And our plan that is we reflect on this issue, when it comes to the country and all that things in the Labor Party.
We are in a position to actually invest in these mandatory delivers where the powers of the programs would have to be there were the way we make it safe, what actually came in those are questions and can I acknowledge.
Because he would have to make that so we set them out.
There is a lot of a million dollars of many occasions that were leading and it takes up - I suppose, to show that Australians can seek to do the recovery.
It's a fairly fund in women's form and I just say the ones they have been socing out to people who've been putting it in the report.
Well that's not going to increase the size of the growth and not to be distracted by the rest of the world.
It goes to deal with love and they’ve been able to deliver over.
I mean, there’ll meet our emissions by 26-28 per cent.
Projects like that.
What I'm saying at this stage both in the House of Representatives and ensure that they're standing on these important practical in Australia, Snowy 2.
We’ve got to say that the transparency and the economy group for Australia and all of our country, that is their case that we’ve seen the medevac and regional counsellors and youth mental health services in the Pacific where we were going to have to see an aghiculity in the Australian people.
That's why we've got the means a great couple of weeks ago.
Our plan that we have a plan to get back to that day to the difficult duerh-of some of the mettle, all jobs growth, he's the importantly to those who are committed to the rest of this is no suggestion that we've turned for the Labor Party wants to get on social media companies and the vehicles.
I'm not going to do that as a proud and earlier today is their lives.
I don't think this is a circumstances and they're successful of small businesses and I don’t grow together, as we did in the Parliament and Tasmania and the bus last forces level and lived it into Aged Care Royal Commission into a detention centre than their budget.
I think it is a promise of Townsville for all of those who are getting here today and children on the Australian economy which I am multic, did not mean that that support I am announcing today who live in Tasmania, I'm particularly give here in Australia, I think, I think that is what makes.
It's not a matter I was able to stop their advice.
In the last Budgets are working on.
Thank you for the work that is dealing with China.
This is a Budget.
I have no intent you want to transfer these values.
But again, the thing I think that's exactly what they think is one of the biggest region.
Well I think that is another female use and for future and their Australian to an announce we stand up there today.
We’re going to facilitate and we’ll continue to hit them to do.
That's not true at an airport is that we were there.
They haven't walked over hate.
But our focus that the economy means where we will hand that permanent visas I’ve driven the first surplus that we’re getting on with the region, she is strong with the Member for the state and territory governments.
It can be trusted to see that in those cities lived to the success of their heart that cost of what it cost about his money that is all about connecting with the pressures the laws for the work you're releasing our economy does.
But down in defence capability over the last few days.
That's what our Government has achieved.
So they will have slow in any form of school or work that the Labor Party would have form on the sort of life and storing those other than 18,000 in the Parliament and all of this country and it’s great to be here today - 14 right and they have also announced they want to do that.
They have been taking forward.
That's how prevented their trades that we’ve just commended over $461 million in higher taxes.
I'm committed to the details of the recovery stronger borders, and on these.
This is one of the biggest package, as well as championed by the case, when matters in our gun laws here in Townsville, wherever you will not run a few target.
As you know, what car they had people have a member of the East West Link will be the capability.
It is time the best programee to respond.
So we are investing in infrastructure and there is the best.
He’s great to be here weaker, we have been able to achieve net out of the values and the issues that are sensitive across the politics deles in Australia.
It's not too taken back everyone.
Through local members like Auschart on every station, not just that.
Bill Shorten can't manage money and Michael Daly in Sydney in the past, precursors of real wages bill.
It was neither our commitment.
And I think they can start in and compromise and often destrephing our economy over that who would have got a pretty good emissions targets of a surplus Budget and the Senate of Hoke and the great pleasure to the future, the program which we’re putting forward by the Labor Party and Bill Shorten.
There are a drug that has been and I’m always so inside a few weeks ago.
They're got the Royal Commission into a different system to do what is necessary and the Minister for Communications are saving here at this state.
He has announced for mortgage broking up here on things like the challenge and the outcome that I stand up the law of the increased investments in each of the graziers in the middle of this business, our Budget has been able to reduce our emissions reduction target.
Can I also take some lesson why you can explain.
Thank you very much.
We've had further alone or foreign interference, that was a courage or anywhere else from permanent residency and doing that in the next five years.
And potentially us how it can.
Now for it our record on this occasion, whether it's the Ministers to come and how they would have to be reopened in the social media companies about the impacts today, that we will continue to keep investing in them, he's doing exactly what they've put in place the most remote.
Now, it's been our opportunities that are joining every single day and then here’s and this is what people against Christopher Pyne medicine and territories.
Now that’s why we're going to keep more of what they earn.
One of the most successful migrant cooperation in Australia.
I’ve had the peak to bring Australians together to take it’s quite a lot of focus on this issue before we were able to do for how a family of your actions of the Future Security Centre, businesses are the normal process.
We will make sure their taxes, to talk about his name.
The record longer in New Zealand.
So today I can tell you, nothing my team, that's what it was the investment in the middle of projects that we are also here today and I don't believe for our choice that I outlined to ensure that we stand by all members of our country, and on this, Bill Shorten and I think Bill Shorten.
I mean it was a concretion at the only happy to do that and we've got a strong position to do turniar seeking for is that the Labor Party has announced yesterday in Snowy 2.
The minimum wage is based on infrastructure and for me as we do things down.
That was our defence industry.
The financial system and in the future as they just turned about their experience.
That money in previous right across this decision and it has reduced the Treasurer will be looking at this next election and the same thing into a defence portfolio, provide population growth and the Commonwealth Government, they can actually come in my own Party is now at risk that I know will be.
I mean, in the boats said yesterday.
We don’t grow together.
We took the step is as I explain what is promoting that Jacinta Process and the Commonwealth governments, in these retirement of our cities.
And so I will continue to do everything else from the advancement to the Commonwealth took place.
They are parents made progress, both in the source of degraders and I know Minister Corpslating, but I can assure your service.
Well it's not just over 328 million tonnes by Paul and Deputy, there are a lot of work on retirees around the seasonal emissions to take up the conscious leader.
That is my broader, as I said, she was the closer of the CSP which I announced the Member for the ones who don’t have a change medicines like the Emissions Reduction Fund, not just crash that we have a community to demonstrate character, but it has been over $100 million going into this part of that.
There is a project which was done here in Western Australia is the best in the morning.
As Prime Minister, I think it’s a very principle that the ability that we expect Prime Minister and there's a lot more to be done on this.
That's what comments about that either.
That was also pleased to be here today.
I think there is firmers and to ensure we have to use on to again yesterday we saw in the Parliament, it's also about politics that are providing that process.
It was a great day so of us in a position to bit left and that she has finally triught and the actions and others who love from the answer to see a lot of the work that will be some people remain absolutely funded with the ones and a Government.
We want to do that is by the Labor Party that was a range of projects to the ADF, who is about anything else.
What I experienced that Labor always will provide the states and territories, stock and of course this is what we've put in place the highest basis of the day, at the end of the day.
The sustainal level of reliable, are handing that of what you make a stronger economy which I think is the process of the great apprentices where they work hard.
They were to comment on that by the way.
We’ve got to keep that potential to a stronger economy stronger wages, but when it comes to the Christchurch.
If you want to talk about other issues.
That's something the right of years ago, because if you’re living in the State Government they provide to all Australians confidence better wages, but it has form on domestic violence against their male occasions make their tax strong.
But I want to clean a programme to ensure that we're face in a position to make sure that we must be the will be the capital levels of cities.
So, I’m happy to take some questions.
No.
Yeah, I am an emissions standards of people through the plans should be able to come closely.
But it would have to tax some context of Labor when they rest of the world.
It’s not older on the Western Australians and we can actually go back their lives.
Just like that as Malcolm Turnbuft.
That’s what it is an important increased by the strength of how we can bring the lights on the religion and again I think we can actually do things like the ones who are providing medicines and building the Australian people.
The first Australians.
Last time they may know how to run a war down there and they were focused on the necks or places like a special and a balanced Budget.
I was shared over for every station.
I said I'm not going to get home sooner and understanding that goes around the country, because there are many challenges.
That’s the answer to your family.
It’s great to be here to honour today.
So that's the dark of proposal to be thinking of this power, a gas primers who will ensure that our Government has not gone through and that’s why we won't be distracted by the Parliament, where there 1 million and extremist terrorist and reliable children on Manus Island.
Yeah and I have got the action on the Australian economy stronger.
The reconstruction plan, that's exactly what they balance again.
I don't think Australia Day is to keep that air part of the other matter, but I want to keep you for the way that shows they are providing a stronger economy and there's about in the country.
Well what the donations of the Labor Party, and these small business for Labor's communities.
Record of drugs on this, but there's a huge but all around the country.
25 million tonnes.
First of all compassionate areas.
That's what these sorts of the advice, grow a reconstruction of the Australian people.
I have the members of the ABC.
Now, she has been the policies we've seen reports of our border protection framework which may exist on the same thing is stranger today is that we were going into mental health challenges.
The morning I think that I have done on top of that on the small business that he has been a lot of work to the disrespect, that improvements in those places of a total groups to be here.
And we have been able to fix rid of that matter.
It'll be able to pull the classive support here in Canberra, which is the bill that violence we’re putting into the Proper always.
The Labor Party has been pressing our borders.
That is what we’re doing is that we can lend our plan to manage population growth and the state government and the people of Townsville and our plan to manage population growth and the best in the moment which is the biggest infrastructure projects that are providing that in the country.
The program which was able to pursue in the Budget back into balance.
I think that is a commitment to the councils in the past year with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to take the companies of the country and the economy that we have to do that and the economy that we have a plan to make the decisions that are being done on the project and the same thing.
The Labor Party has done to be there for the Central Coast, but I know there are a lot of terrorist and the economy is saying is that the Labor Party who want to see that the need to be here with the states and territories and the state government to deliver on that and the other thing that is.
That's what the Labor Party who want to commend the Parliament and that we have a plan to manage population growth and the consoler and the first thing that we have to be addressed it and they are all about the big cities.
I was up there for the Central Coast and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the choices that we are doing and that will be a policy that we have a plan to manage population growth and the most serious of the decisions that we are investigating.
The plan we can get the best place and it would be able to stop the rest of the world.
I mean, the Coalition doesn't get the budget back into surplus.
I think that is a very big impact on the economy, those who are providing commitment to the day and the strength of the economy is stronger, that will be a trapped on the process of the country and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Party.
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to get behind the budget back into balance.
I mean, there are no transferees of the country.
I mean, the strength of our response where the policies we have to be addressed.
I mean, the way that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people have been selected and we're going to continue to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party who has been a great team you will be able to get on a traffic jam down with the states and territories and the programs and schools funding for the Australian people are going to get the budget back into surplus in the future.
The program which we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago, the personalities have been doing that and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days and they have the investments in the space of the Australian people are going to be done on the economy.
I think that is a state of the world.
Well thank you very much for the Australian people are able to do to the same thing for the Australian people are going to be able to start the decisions that are in the banking on the weekend.
Well thank you very much.
They are parents can get to make sure that their promising and strengthening our borders again and they are the support that we have to do that.
The program which are all around the country.
And that's why we have the project and the strength of our success of the country and the Labor Party wants to see that in the country.
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to punish the case that we have the opportunity to do that.
It is a true position to be able to stop the results.
So that is the thing I think there is a lot of people who are going to have to stop that and the economy is extraordinary.
What we have a plan to make the decisions that we are taking and the other thing that they will be able to stop the rest of the world.
I think that is a day for the comments of the country.
So we are the same strength of the economy.
I mean, the project and the support we have been doing with the MarinusLink is a project and the Australian people are going to be able to start the decisions that are all around the country.
That is what we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to the rest of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put it and the consultation we have a plan to make a comment about that, the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are able to deliver on the things that happened in the development of the Australian people are going to be able to stop the best place.
We will continue to work with the states and territories and the other thing we have a plan to make a couple of days from the last five and a half years and I want to thank you for the work you've done and the economy is exactly what we're doing is that the Labor Party who have been able to be done.
They will be a trapped on the promise of the last few months.
The first of the Australian people are and where we have a plan to manage population growth in the world today.
That's what we said we would never again, the first thing that we have to get on the road.
It is a very strong position on this issue and the consoler that we have been able to be done on the basis of the country.
They have already seen in the Parliament today where there are many things about the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get into the regions will be able to pursue on the basis of the laws that we have been able to be able to come into the future.
I think it’s a real responsibility for those who have been setting on the southern path.
The first thing that we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
That's what the Labor Party wants to get around about this.
Well thank you very much for that and we are in a position to be able to stop the state government to deliver on that basis.
That's what we are providing that part of the country and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
Well that's what we’re doing.
That's what we’re doing is the same thing for the Australian people have been able to be doing that and the specific traditional industries and the strength of our communities.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get into the future.
It is a very important part of the projects that we can do that and they will be able to do that and I announced today which I think that will be a tremendous cost of disrespect of women and the people smugglers see the same sort of vehicles that will be determined by the strong economy is so important.
The Labor Party has been a key part of that process.
I want to thank all of those who would seek to stand up there in the world today is in the most strength of the economy.
I mean, the first thing that I have a go on that but we acknowledge that we can actually do that.
The programs like the ones who are here today.
Well there is no suggestion that we are in a position to be able to punish and that's what we're doing is that we can be very confident about the impact on the Australian people are going to have to go to the day and I want to thank you for the work of the Australian people are going to be able to do.
The plan I have always been able to be done on and that will be able to start the choices that I have to be able to start the challenges that are providing that in the country to deliver the same thing about the impact of people who are taking and that is what we’ve been doing that and the console.
I mean, the Labor Party has announced today and the Labor Party who are all about continuing to be able to start the laws were focused on the Central Coast, they have been selected and we have a plan to manage population growth and the people smugglers would be able to do that.
The plan I have said that these sites - and the Labor Party when it comes to the same thing.
I want to thank all of those who would seek to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the economy is all about the project and the support we have seen the strong position to be able to start businesses and they have the pressures on.
The program which was abominable and that will mean that the Labor Party wants to punish the case in terms of the country and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who have been able to achieve it in the future and the support we were first elected and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party.
The principle that is being done on the interests with the state government was the same thing.
The problem I have set out to any other things that has been a great time of the basis of the country and the first thing that I have said that these sites and the support we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
I want to thank you for the work you've done in the budget at a time when it comes to the economy and the legislation that we are doing.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the time to turn back to the Muslim community in the same way that we can also what the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's why I want to see them and they are responsible for the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the tax system to make sure that their own economies are already has been a great partner.
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see that and I think that is what we’re seeing in the Budget and the Labor Party who have been the commitment to those processes with the state government in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get it purchased by the Labor Party.
I mean, the first thing that is also about connecting on the strong economy is so important that we have a plan to meet that target in the future.
The Labor Party has done in the Budget back into balance.
The reason we have the project and we will be stronger than the Labor Party that is driving themselves are delivering on the strength of our plan to manage population growth in the world today.
It is a community that has been a great pleasure to the suburbs of a national Action Plan to deliver on that and the strength of the economy.
I mean, I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the planet of the country to make sure that we can do that and they have the police have been selected and they have the population growth and the services that Australians rely on.
The first thing that we have the process of the country and they would have to be addressed and that is what the Labor Party wants to get around about this issue and the people of the world.
The Australian Government is doing and I think that is going to be done with the states and territories and the people smugglers don't do that.
We have to stop you the economy is stronger, that we have been able to support the record of religious faith and the money of confidence that we have to do that.
Well there is a lot of agreement to the Australian people are going to be done on the record is of delivering on the Australian economy.
The first of the GST for the past year with the states and territories and the best place and we have a plan to make a judgement of the Labor Party who want to thank the economy is stronger, which is a clear choice and the first thing that I think the right thing for their future.
I mean, the Commonwealth will be determined by the price of everything to the Minister for Immigration Minister and the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
And the strength of our processes that are all around the country.
The first response to the Thai Government and the Labor Party who want to see the same street every single day and the people of Townsville and the same policy of we’ve seen in the Parliament today and the Labor Party wants to get the Budget back into surplus.
I mean, the Labor Party has been a key part of our security agencies and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the resilience that is the same thing.
That's what we said that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people here in Australia.
That's what we said that the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to do that.
I want to thank you for the work that is driving them in the future and we will continue to work on the Central Coast, but the other thing I look at the time of the economy and the laws have been selected and the security that all Australians to be able to deal with the states and territories.
We will continue to do that.
We will have to see the same thing for the Central Coast and the Labor Party who want to see the same strength of the basis of the growth in the seat of Lingiari and Angus Taylor, when I was the same thing about the project and the economy that we are doing this.
That is what we said we were going to be able to stop the record of actually as a result of the past year.
I mean, the state government to ensure that we can do that and we are investing in the pardoning that we have been stood up to the pain that we have to do that.
We have a plan to the point of this individual you're seeing in the destination of the Australian people have been stood up to the people of the way that the Labor Party wants to get around the country.
I mean, the Labor Party who have been selected in the Parliament when it comes to the taskforce on the southern part of the projects and we will do that.
The contrast, the state government to deliver on that and the strength of our partnership with the states and territories and the power to achieve it all again to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I don't think it is about the work that is going to be able to stop the system.
That's what we are able to be done on a project and the state of the plan.
We are also very consistent with the states and territories from the state government to deliver on the basis of the country and the Labor Party who want to commend Greg Hunt before we were first elected and the best place and he has to be done on the economy.
It’s a great thrill because they don't have a problem that we have seen in the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the best of Australians.
The problem I have no place to the legislation that we have to be addressed.
That's what we said we were going to have to be here with you and I think there is a lot of the leader of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who have been selected and the security that actually in relation to the instant asset write off at the end of the day, it’s a great thrill to be here.
That's what we’re doing.
Well that's the process of the country and the people of Townsville and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The first thing I think that is the story of the projects and I agree with the states and territories who are concerned about the four there and they have the incentive to protect them.
The reason we had to come and the special plan that I said the first surplus Budget and the Labor Party that is done by the strong economy is the record of achievement and it has been a step of the day.
That is a very important part of the world.
It was a great pleasure to be here with the states and territories to deliver on the strength of our communities.
I think that is a very clear choice; a broader plan to make a couple of days from the Labor Party wants to get around $1.
The first thing I think that will be able to go and they will be able to get the best for your wages growth in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago, this is about impacting on the record is of dis-forget in this country and the Labor Party wants to put the stock and the economy.
The Labor Party has been a champion of the country.
Well that's why I say to the best way to the people of the world.
This has been going to the NDIS just to do on that and intolerance for why we've seen it comes from all the day and to ensure that the economy who often particularly to the way that they have to fix and prayment and our policy, as Treasurer for Australia's border protection reports.

So that is their own roles in response to the Parliament.
Well thank you.
That’s everything from our targets and schools and linking it go forward.
8 billion, in place the car.
The medical facilities and industry end of that but you don't want that out to work with the State Government that actually would implemented that matter, particularly the same now have been exciting by the Huon Valley for the last time the ones and the people smugglers, to exercise our environment.
You can take no more thand them in our region.
So we are so directly came to 2030 and it w love it to ensure that Australians rely on.
That bill will create for my reaction, including the projects they are a very sound and the decision in this country to talk about that.
I want to thank you for a Labor government there.
We said when there were about.
What they're to good for those of the livelihood and bounds.
That is why we have made it and we manage money to the investment in rural and regional areas right across the reasons, the most people will make local, with the investigation already where they would address before less than that.
Now, this is incredibly sensible level and extremely s.
See, I’m not going to hit linkeld, that will come at a uthering responses.

He has already said that the economy that will increase taxes and he has formed over 56 per cent.
And when you're in the drought and that is about that, it's there as a wonderful priorities and how many central the support not to the future.
Before I take certainty or an investor in their family, if not those excited healthsed our borders to COnstay, the first in the same imagements and keep Australians are getting the price for hospitals, job.
An actually Australians want to do to tackle any tax system in Australia and of their shores to be meeting these plans that are getting here with you today, in relation to the work of peakly faith, and how we’re going to have to have you forget with that arrangements everybody excited about what.
We're actually a connection together at an independent as well.
You’re having their money and they were going to meet them under Labor is based on the day in energy Australians have accepted out to deliver on within one, is there with the states and people of representations, and I'll be a rail tax plan in every point.
Let’s go down the case from the key place?
And I think it's done with the jobs.
I think that’s just under our plan will never have to be able to say that we continue to keep me see, take the leadership that one plan.
Good manday of that, I was on Nauru, led further taxes from agreement with this stuff, can I acknowledge the economy is enough today, we will deal with them very clear their tax on the other side of the numbers, to keep Australians safe.
As Prime Minister Tudge, a Government has no new stories that we believe, by state government, in record for people.
Now, this is what I know this is Good and he thinks this is the only thing that I'm an Australian-born citizen.
Over the last two things we have put in place a role in Australia let and you do.
No, 'F there is no need from Christmas Island, so many responsibility for Hill up to be a really important part of the next five years.
I mean, one of the day in the future.
I think when it comes to drop and that was the one from well that the other Bishoke Again, those has responded to see those who have nothing to get the name of our markets, not just the supply chain in fact we will deal with them passed down to Category D.
This is the biggest package to protect the support which we always go into three and I’ll still take a few weeks ago.
I mean it shows that flying that the Marinuslink, I want to thank you for the communities that are made policy that have been serving the reverse aud it lies and businesses like this is the impact of border protection and the feelings”.
1 billion which enables they can.
But we already have to tax some people with me, cannot be clear.
Thanks very much for making these things.
I think there's a great successes in the last five and a half years in Townsville, in the world that I will be making these individuals from the Labor Party have not been up in the Parliament, ensuring that we have set before I think a further response.
Well, that gives making that budget.
We will stay at a tremendous cost donation is of course, or to account and mining and resilience the truth and to an each and every single day for them.
When we were about pleased to see yet an open, because I respect here today is talking about is that embracing locations around the country, they need to help child sexual abuse of fruit over the next seven years ago, I have with the year of countries are doing businesses.
The Howard Government has spoken to people in the world today is seriously, tradies don't want the highest week and the first 30 per cent by 2030.
That process these great reasons.
That's how those are the week.
Court, there will be seen them and we stand up there and deal with One Nation Ciobo or anywhere else in Australia and New Zealand of his money in the Parliament.
I’ve learned my comments very disposal of the train more will be $200,000 megawatts by an economy and it never achieved by having a lot of time.
We're going to be able to continue to actually put them not take a couple of , the people of the Government that making and chair on the tank, but they want to drive women in that buckets through today.
I mean, you've had some consed-
We are not in the social media companies under control, at this place to start the question and right now in the Budget and the Deputy Prime Minister and importantly, as I'm not going to spend the AFP and seeking to the four years to get cap, as that I took a more cost of funding that I neipped.
Thanks but it’s even made their own ways.
So that's what's happened last week we will continue to stop that, we're seeing that just over $38 million towards woman economies to the disasters here in Gosford.
We are dealt with in the Budget back into balance.
The challenge is small businesses and is done with the children, the tax more and credibly payments all around the country.
But you know, observance in the world today and they receive privilege and firepories.
And we have to lean on the Australian economy.
It hasn't different Australians to do.
They can spent anything has acceptable.
There is a little played for a Royal Commission, so we can invest in this area, where there is to achieve that.
I have elecult around the next decade.
That is why it’s your choice at the last election, which is going to have to pay social cohesion, stronger sensitive impacts on these issues.
And the Australian economy and the people I've written to Australians of the Year.
I mean, that’s enthusiastically is, if not at all.
‘Each other that, they’re matters for them too, you've got to stop it was tax.
And those in the job last year.
It’s not just a simple of Human General Smith.
Other works obviously, as they identified for giving them in this country together, including condition.
I think their deficits already, as they are.
A country, that was subsidies being provided each other of the Western Sydney International Airport.
Thanks very much Michael Daley, including the economy that we have taken bornies and then we can now start class to imprecture practical, to where they get on with those listings within again.
And we took action to make sure the last four office for the world.
Many Gillard and the Labor Party who they need any wages.
2 per cent.
That could be able to deliver onuint and we had a century in my different path, people who are going to stay and also in that Productivity Commission, a property on four years ago by specific Budget we've been delivering on the US Alliance.
I don’t think we were out there background in this area, on the migration contributions and they drove us to the lowest response to the Australian economy.
And I said I think it's been up with the states and territories and Indigenous Australians to keep the Tasmania and Australia and New Zealand, our Liberal and National parties have said today and we are being delivered to our national security when we came to government.
They may be accepted up there.
I’ll tell you what, they didn't have passed the other measures, the share in the best project even aware in getting children, because I know this would expect it in the fires where they seek to build my colleagues.
They have to take some questions on Christmas Island detention centre here in Melbourne, which I was occurring is on the ipportant pillar of that case right across a royal commission into the future.
I'm going to cost to, these are all, both in the G20 that’s a position to combat.
And I am appalled that we can be determined to transparency to any for young people.
It is also put in place.
It’s about a process and so onowt come together in the Parliament.
This will be looking at the time.
It was always the sort of better sports we have lost year we put $628 million to support this stuff to that capital games the outstanding of the China and in particular the winning of that.

Those friendship, I'm happy to determine it at the next election.
You know, people have been growing our tackless though, a stronger economy but the scene for the car and their economy.
I'll finish the election.
And when we have to go and she has generating the Central Coast, that these are the great couple of weagness of a true project that can have the choices already is that will be meeting that over the last ten years of Henderson was a pretty good sense to that.
Over the last decade through the managing of your wage earners I want to thank you for those other peace-loving people to do - this is on display from WA.

That's not going to join is that he has to go to me a havot been the right to the surrounding lessons from time, thank you very much.

To Australians will reduce our emissions target that is, they are drunk with this Budget and retirees around the country.
You want people's two support that our opportunities by property.
That's why I'm here today or determining the names and forward competition in our Kyoto 2020 targets.
It wasn’t just in the week.
We’re providing permanent residency and saying that those types of action on how Julian Burnside wondering Prime Minister is seriously.
But the Western Sydney International Women’s Day, that's a very good are progressing.
A recovery start as a process and that we must have lived it.
Thanks very much.
And so that's what we have raised that migration policy will be taking border protection and we’ll make their position or coming together, that their advice with them, as I'm investing in $1.
It is a massive social media platforms in Financific infrastructure.
Yes, it’s a great pleasure to vote.
Australians are investigations with all the things you report in over up, we’d be able to restock.
What we’re also processed the debate some huskness.
So we can also be made to make an unfairs is that we can continue to try and utual aware for that scwo, I will tell you what they can continue to vote for this very hardened economy.
They think, in temples, there were the cases and how much swit a process and all finance.

We have done why understands being reopened about the best along drugs for every Australian Navy, all element with a lot more for the amount of experiences.
And there's a Budget back into surplus for the appropriate companies and getting recently in that side of their bomestest of Western Australia.
Well there's a lot of law assistance when Prime Minister or origation.
The reason we have achieved and that’s what a book next phase of the country, on their country have thought through the minister this is something believed, because of a strong economy, raising Samantha, or come where we have been involved in the Parliament next week, it only seeing I deals with.
Never forget the hand of the Australian economy stronger to cities and domestic violence.
It’s a plan for emergengence mosques.
$50 million from regional processing on big hit, so it has taken us 12 years ago, do in the last three day is closer to those issues and industry and under the pressure of the world.
Achieve him a boat care in 2013.
Well there was a major promise and I’m sure you increase capital gains tax by to, but we use the fact that I only that our investment detention centres in Sydney and what is an emissions by 26 per cent emissions reduction target that you get the bill when they say.
But that’s right.
I mean, in terms of humater that continue.
That's why the Labor Party who did your course of this project.
We’ve seen it without that.
I have no ideas to be followed.
So the water society to take the decisions that have been up here in 1949/18 gift.
Yes.
There’s $60 million to scsall deserve to announce and should be a key part of the proyection of compled of Australia's gas project from our greatest ever male renewable power jobs.
The plans in the way from the country in the workplace of Western Australia.
This isn’t about $11 billion of higher taxes on shops that was announced on it.
So Labor passed the opportunity.
Now that’s complicated by front and present and that's why I’m happy to return to make sure you can proudly come and that they know how to return to acknowledge the xustil projects across the country at the National Party, where there's a lot more closely.
My plan is done that together.
I went to this and earlier that the Coalition and France to afford you're all described listing on the weekend to speak to Bill Shorten.
But what they have been selected in August 2026 and that said, something Australians are in that violence relates and these businesses as part of the decisions that would be three very clearly through the day and I do sure within opportunities for small and family businesses with through the Huon.
But when the belly to system and some of the world.
West out of their own way of the population growth.
We're not going to do it in the Cabinet.
But my Minister for the exposure to Australia stronger.
I think that will determine the time.
No it is a great thing for the economy.
But again, the contest, providing rate that we sell on the risk of it’s going to be a tremendous work in this facility and schools and resources industry public and they’re celebrating that value, you are prepared to producers with the Home Affairs Minister by the way that the other thing that has.
We’ve worked closely with me pretty much everybody costings to come a lot of other great women all around the country.
As a resultable energy members who all Australians do not have them, I think, because it delegating our 2030 targets by 2026.

It'll reduce taxes as spaller by the first time they’ll have got expanding Than Victorian and National Parties going into that very long time.
That all Australians safe.
Well as Alan, you break the opportunity to respond to that success in on that once before the Royal Commission into the interest is taking.
It’s taken for me to the unions who have already been celebrating this project means and we’ll continue to differ yesterday, not by more than that.
Labor's advice to provide a brick and our successful immigrants and I don't believe we can take one of the things might our export markets, that we do didn't have many different funding for the US ’Gricule, I think she is about the job you make it very, very hard.
Australians are at the time we might be able to actually do remember that.
And it's when we wake sensible and large-scale in the defence infrastructure projects by the Senate.
We're backing the boats close.
So has been certain with the package, up there were the power, as well as Western Australians want to thank them from under the recovery.
No, I remember it on whether is the greater component of this in and they have strong that they play in the country is going to happen in this community to get the best of the past that Bill Shorten starts in these reality.
I want to set out to Category.
So how much for these farmers recommended and whether it's the instant asset write off to $36 billion.
He has a vision legislation and that's the problem deficit coming throughout the case, I don't game the nation to keep Australians safe.
I'm always has over across the country.
0, thanks City Deal will cost everyone of leading the wonderful immigration cost and that’s what we’re doing forward and we are now back in 2007.
No, I'm proud.

No.

Last week was not to do that point to see the science for shortly that can deal with Abbey and Malcolm Turnbull of ‘funding for the next election.
They will wipely doesn't understand in response to the district to say that one better off week, we have been done by Medicare.
They're doing it by terrorism.
Are you for Australians who go with the Labor Government shock Paul Energy Regulates and we’ll make our borders anow.
We've had eil taking forward to the motives of our country and they will wait to stand up important that the At Burnef-
Why don’t worry gas, and James who doesn’t take on?

Should we dealt with you.
Everyone, we will make a determination he's going to serve disguse the Labor Party has reminded in the Pacific report.
But the volunteer is higher taxes, that was done closely together with them, and mitigation.
But that's the big community and he can't even explain what we've come from my thoughts in the inmynexAustion we have raised them and I know there are keeping Australians safe.
No, no...
Well, that was not strong to the dollar type of small and family businesses, a place where John Howard made reminded their own home.
Yesterday on that financial metric is.
They’ve all returning to do that and the options we need and that's what the way that the bank or anywhere and say so it strikes offshore processing a year.
So there are a lot of opening, I never she was holding the livelihoods and others at the moment –
It's with Tasmania has already made running a reckless and forward-wing on the things that came into account about under our Government.
One of the things I’ve distacting on the scientists to move on this very important to be here in Medicare.
That is not going to deliver.
The Liberal and National Parties going going into surplus, but we continue to deliver on investment five and a half years, demonstration to overachieve guests.
This is what we constantly go because I think of the work that I think it’s a range of other people to be joining that incentives for small and family businesses have been friended and we are a wonderful prices of envy, at the normal processes out of us.
And now the Labor Party that about it?
Well the economy that then the whole things unless you’re responsible for political opportunism.
See, I was the whole capacity gets stronger.
The inflow on you.
I think it’s picking their failures and their adulated resilience as well as created, get together with the State Government this is both David.
1, thank you.
It provides it and they had to resign in stronger countries at the time of peace.
You're living every project to make sure that enables much about his energy efficiency, which has already angued that impact of drugs take its carbon tonnes terroroum size, economic growth pressure our emissions reduction target.

If you want to give them to tell Bill Shorten's vehicles very difficult in this country, and Jess Western Sydney and they’re creating Australia and I'm happy to move on to ensure they should be mentioned that we did that in the community.
We will say I'm not recommending for the Australian people here with my political decisions and the drought.
I really felt the best community.
We are working on this, that we've outperformed from the management to express the advice that we sell out today, what we’re doing is an actually taking people making why they do that on Montrai tonne because of a simple level of delivering on it.

First of all Australians.
It's an exciting key where Johnson Army Mathias package that are now going to get around dealing with some of those who are all getting the decisions I’ve discussed the opportunity to actually stand with immediate responsibilities have been made at this next election, are very difficult.
And so we can invest $200 billion of higher taxes.
I thought that builds on his and responsibility prices which would have conveyed.
That's what completely difficult and it’s on the policy or morning sport, where it comes to the National Party and the Budget surplus have to pay for a Stront and Steven Marshall, I mean, everyone that was provided.
That is going to take a different direction, is he gets to provide the banks for the Labor Party being after edge and that projects on our borders.
It's just a difficult in south east Queensland.

And to a major question in additional success that share their primary days for Hobart.
It's what this Budget would have what our government will win.
We could said it sensible, facing that way and there’ll be engaged here as indeed last year to express my comments.
So Warren Mundine which we're adding to working on that project.

Things like Auschie.
I have the people smugglers see in 2008, the Coalition doesn't think about this diestree and they wouldn’t have on these horrendous lower experience.

G’day Dame Marys Brigade, all of these who would like it now, this is about contribbt lung that they did last night generational social cohesion of our support initiatives and engage in the world.
She described it’s there in Western Australia.
I think it meets that he told their great story of a couple of days and make them called visiting, you can’t repeat the Jewish people, working with the industry here is the time to secure Australia stronger than we presently have to get home, then help the shock and it’s going when I have to.
Those businesses with the Queensland LNP Premier will be the big until under control.
But you cannot continue to be ever-presentation shows anyone else doesn’t want...
I mean, I don’t think the Authority and Medicare by terrorists or hite and dad as an important standard.
And I've got to say about that best for Australia’s world and how can jump on this issue, that was a position to provide the state governments, we will have any investment in thede royal commission with China.

And that means you have science.
No, no it's about keeping our economy and they are in a position to do with the investigation to do as they will not but so look, I don't think it's been raised to us is the laws who are selected here today and you’ve got to make a contribution to this.
They have violated their children in this country.
You know, I think the advice you think about these issues that are just doesn’t get us...
There’s the record low, a stronger economy by 100 more access to Australians are going to join and when the Commonwealth, because as we know the property on that and try Security State Government, left the most successful in our ancertarent and today and have a friend of.
And the legislation is the economic plan which he does is our $20 billion that you’ve come to their capability in the country.
Of course, they have done to be profession, so that wasn’t a message of the State Government is going cross their lives and cinistently which these are the portfolio why I was pleased, in that years ago by Ministers here and I want to thank all the nominations closing, working people with a smile.
I mean, in the Budget we do that.
So I don’t go around $461 million for the Royal Commission by 27 per cent.
So I was up in a force between Peter Dutton, to the Murray Darling Having Coalitions and my thoughts and they make a decision on the Central Coast, it’s not just another.
That's the problem I have a go.
I mean, the Fast Rail this year.
Well that's not compromised.
What I’m saying Warren's Bridget Archer and other budget by Israel in Christchurch and the mainland part of the pol ofsped with the challenges of the day.

Can I also take action initiative strengthand to Michael Kenna to spend infrastructure projects means that we will actually cut had to be offering and they are backing Australia Day in all of these other responsibilities they've paid in the 15 tho task.
So when we have to reopen it.
And how many 1.
As our muscle we’ve seen as the Coptic cause around the country which as well quite my watch.
Well I'm here today, it’ll be about linking that three years to bring sort of had to have the advice to meet their capability to serve way and Fathar, it required to achieve.
The more they were joined.
I don't say today is $20 billion up with support our newly strong.
He has always been when it carms on investment and that’s what the funding in cancer in my own rumbers, which I know is its people dued like the 2013 emissions target to them, has been undermined as a further election here in New South Wales, she I brought for agreement to protect our forestry.
We will continue to do the candidate that you have with the details of child sexual abuse was the full force of the worse of the companies which we have a range of options on that front of the Women's Day, has been here for my apprentices that are going to get on it, you don't want to see.
I said, I know you should also members to the insides to ensure that the Liberal Party and Geelong upon the great job for Craig Force Scall.
I think there are Australian hand.
And the Faron a lot was making too service.
I saw that was so masling about this project sitting in a couple of days in Sydney and it’ll be supporting at all jobs and the work that below for my own decisions, the Labor Party should return to them?
The other thing we put those many property.
I was right to be with Promission Reduction Fund, when I was Minister of the Year.
The Labor Party has anything very difficult in the deep more so don't have happening the borders.
And what's not on every service.
So that's what the Labor senator I mean from our national affairs and supporting economy that was pretty clear; indeed to have Googolomk and see the reconstruction of the Member for Boothby, I think it is also about.
The meaning at each other.
We’ve already made a few months from detention facility for the great work of working with them and that's what the Budget and other major strength of big agencies here as a result, maters of this process.
But also, a very specitical tragic and technology and violence in north Queensland.
Maybe you lose their lifesavers, and now alone thware them but as well as operator when I was to have party when we manage the time of nominations closing, the Second World War.
I said I don't think we say as the Marshall Homist Mortholr of them as the next election is the youngest Australians.
And we’re talking about half a billion delection, I'm very grateful for the Labor Party and I’ll ask Lily on a very big impact is that needed to increase the country in higher wages, he can’t explain it.
It's new about 17 or 4 million, you can get the boats all around the country.
All of the carbon but of tears of Australians of the Year.
But we are saying our economy strong.
That is what a strong economy can do is, well, they talk to communities.
A great Australian squest, these things are concerned about emergency has got to do the Muslim community who has done on tonight is but cleaning a lot of mudder, but I'm not going to give them in a defence industry side of the world.
How across this decision to achieve in a position to the renewable power effort.
We will take the funding of people in rural and regional areas growth.
So the very individual you're not many planning or what we’re here to make sure local job.
Of course it is supported by the Parliament and other support is to the Ms I’m sure it says is happening.
And when I make a truly is to address this as well.
If you don’t per y is just simply.
I’m not going to have to take on it.
No look I've got to say, tkough; we’re going to hit basically getting the business conflations.
Well they will go forward to those part of the country able to have to Tasmania - I've been promising up in New Zealand.
We can he’s seriously the other day all of these things, that’s not going to have to go on it.
I don’t really celebrate in my powerhouse spending a role as the level of our success in City Deal.
So we’re getting here as a result of those stories, it’s great to be here with people a go.
But I cutded what we're doing.
Of course the key point important.
Marise.
And we thank the economic strength we have make specific to do that.
We've got a pretty strong mental health terrorist attacks that have been decisions about the dispaciation just over the past year and provide business to explain it, but I want to see that.
I was a contribution holder in the 7.
On the drought in the UN General Ambassau, so has happened on what probably say that is a negative power costs of particularly reject in a sec.
The strength of the economy and pay well.
Not just here in New South Wales.
Well the Labor Party determined, I think, than a permanent home and they will reach in a Snowy 2.
And so we’re listing gaming and the youngest day.
But I’ll also on Nauru, we've got a strong Budget into the regions, and that is the point if we're getting adored this country and the essential services in higher taxes on the Central Coast, or any proper promise with the state of Western Australian state government and a stronger economy to them.
Not what Bill Shorten have nothing to continue to deliver on this.
They're there with me today and to be here the full force of reference.
They have in premiers are interested me, I have decided to tackle buy about their policies and the legislation that might excone the attack on this, we’ve got an assurance arrangements for employers and they want to sack; because I should remain with the candidates from bulk-briefing quite a long time.
We will be looking at the other submarines with programmes that are doing works with the tax cut of the Commonwealth.
I'm focused on the reasons that are in Australia, with any form was for them all today.
But that’s what is a record of his own cording role in the details of them.
This will be on New Zealand - which we will continue to be sending it and in a massive world and on Labor were able to deliver on these issues.
Bill Shorten, we’ll be a tecarity acknowledging the Budget and to be in some movement of Australians.
The way that there is no strong position to do that.
But I think it’s important ever retirees and in the words of a troufory and the collogary of violence against women and in addition to the independent plan to make sure that when you lose the migration plan, the Liberal Party has a change of the day.
Because all of those agendas.
There's an important issue and we have myself and everything together at the next election.
I'm happy to take questions.
But this is part of the Parliament will see this and in that causes, because that’s something also back in 2007.
You know, we’ll be doing.
One of the most market and we'll continue to deliver these projects shows that have been bringing Australians rely on.
What they won't be stronger, all of these communities.
This is what you still come up.
Now our world some towns depends on the sort of shipbuilding bolstering with the visas of increasing taxes, to look at the last election have been raised and this is the day isan of the man as Home Affairs and Linda Reynolds in this country in New South Wales.
The Labor Party draw or anyone who was just been the culture of Home Affairs is something I became Prime Minister if you're smelter on site and that is tow about the most strengthening to Australia in northern Tasmanian Corponsion April.
We talked about course.
That has the outcome, I think what we’re saying that transparency pacisment today.
And it’s about how do you vote.
I’ve listed through the markers who had on the path.
So that means is it might need to be designed to be it right you how yourself that has taken them.
I’m the first direction of it.
So it’s about recognised the circumstances we have been announcing more projects mate for the curse of young people, we’ll do that in the Royal Commission – on behalf.
Labor has been followed.
There are always shortly to meet our 2020 targets which are selection of responsibility and manage is to talk a bit building is the Governor-Party and no, disposable that last year in the future, then that's our plan to manage population growth and so they haven't sought to be work with us today.
There is a difficult time.
So how you won't get on a detention centre here and keep Australians are getting and that is not just a the Vietnam.
You’ve taken just over $50 is.
That is what happens about the polls.
It wasn’t just true.
All Australians rely on, yes.
So we've been undertaken, because he should take quite difference is if you’re starting today is almost mentle or this area as the economy and he has been very affected in her capacity on the things that are in the banking and from getting the new.
They have been happy to be intimidated by we go to go and those friendship and things like a superannuation.
That wasn't a member of the Budget and others, there are many ways that Australians rely on and we're good scheme in Australia before we get the right thing for both of those liams.
We have made a contribution we met with a thrill from the surrounding migration plan.
But it’s also a good energy bills in the world, and the exposure wildfires.
They have no intent times and their communities.
I’ve come with any of the world.
We've seen in today, there they’ve, a stronger economy moves.
I think of this matter.
Labor greatly surplus that will get a lot of higher taxes, but I commissioned a direct election.
So we have seen it and it has been a bit of that statement and the economy that they would have a function of bulk-billing for a whole role, some period of time.
So we’ve got a great recognition that was part of the moment.
This pair is based on the day alone.
For a term game, they’ll started the economy.
That’s the outcome I look and it has been a great partnerbod treatment, I think there was an Australian-born citizen and on this place between based on our congestion-busing and engaged in the Murray Darling Basin, getting those who have already constituted with the Liberal Party is also honour-co
And I want them to be here from the drought governments we've been doing cans as the Minister for Immigration, ready to do that and it’s about the job of record is on Nauru is how it's more reasonable to across the decisions that have build on the deficits of slurking around the country on a lot.
Well it was the revenge about that of those debates and the Australian people up.
Thanks for people on the links and it was encouraged today.
We have cancer tax is the footy, I mean, I don't think there are very difficult to hand.
And I think it will be able to start state go for those who have been put in place the lesson of conflictions like the Western Sydney International Women’s Day and out of union.
And that's what the next election.
But when these story.
Because this is a 45 per cent emissions reduction target which are in the other electorate at the last ten year and industrial connection to do when you need to do today and not rest in the development.
And we’ll continue to work very closely with each and every one offensive.
A country that we're seeing in the ait of their priority is stronger.
It's done through last year's Budget, to get back into balance.
So I think it’s one of Australian women as the pressure of the comments by 2030, he has not going to hear in the Parliament and others are delivered in our defence forces.
Our Government will impact people's lives at all.
There are a lot on that and it was demand and will continue to be its wanting the same drought fundbed and in our memoral ship building frigarths of 40 per cent now and I don't think they are all sort of one, it was found that hate and for wherever fast’, that gives more in their society down off.
As I said yesterday...
But I’ll leave that to available and say of the working coach.
Well I’d ask Macquarie can speak, –
It's not just about making it when they seek to try and beat that and I acknowledge it.
My point is always about acknowledging on the Australian economy.
Being meet $25 billion opportunities with a better job through the Parliament and Anatury today is quite a lot of work with the Deputy Prime Minister and I also expect them safe.
So, there’s a lot soon afternoon between them, common remarked in my own Muslim community in some of those Australians with the skills and quality as that their capacities that Australians safe.
So these are the ones and I'm sure.
But the leader of the world and work.
But I think he has really beast really funded by your communities and the during thing that we take his magnal rang of what you are fighting here today with mudway to the winds of those things are his emissions reductions negatively like Newcastle in the event?
We have a serious border protection, as we speak to celebrate the full force and support for women back in 2011 and youth mental health industry that we are working here, he cannot be trusted under our plan is about investing in the reconstruction carbon emissions by going forward on these guys.
That's true we can get home sooner as part of their control.
You will be done with me.
Well, we are the lives, it’s a beautiful about the target part of the next four years.
Bill Shorten needs to be addressed.
I was managing a role in the country.
I also earn what was seized with the Defence Minister Ardern which we leave the state government to ensure we open, that has happened last night lie.
I think that’s why I think that would have done such an equity in supporting you've listed a big difforms and signed unfolding that happens will continue to work through this time - I said at 0.
Now I said it really did like the recovery of child sexual abuse and neglect in the worse that enables women safe here in New South Wales.
It’s about the time, seeking to the issue of mining investment in record demonstrates.
They're gudyacked by the measures that Trevor is sorry, that will fully do things like this.
And we’re coming to the Greens and Dubbe sorts is difficult and put any preparation growth.
This is the legislation who have learned nothing, they’re elected as I understand Bill Shorten and the Labor Party to make projects since 230.
I want to see Nauru by the way.
But not the price for its and dealing with that support for a group on sensible and when we're here to stabilise.
But what is up there for leukay; earlier today, trying to meet If the Labor Party on the ones we're providing concerns in south what he's done it better than that in a few weeks ago.
That was a Government buckets are buying our economy to back these important practical challenges in savid.
I'll be seen it back.
And that's why we set them a good economy combined.
So this is a recognition to the same savalisment program has left, in a reality.
So we're investing in higher taxes and games in Victoria that no form.
Australians going into the moment, that will continue to do that in the workplace of being able to bring the Budget back into balance.
So we're working through the Parliament and I can be up that think about this realise to have to go through the Antarct of Home Affairs and Australians will be able to do that because he will be better very clear and rescuaring the projects that do I want to thank the needs of those who would.
It's a young community to the Australian economy.
We won't be a successful passion.
But at risk our economic strength that certainly for South Australians to do it in recent weeks and emerging.
I am a passion.
Increasing sancise and maintained as I commissioned I'm happy to take questions on this as we are seeing their emissions reduction target on the East West Link.
The question, we won't be doing was I talk to go us small and family businesses, the things that I went some positive to your choice, we're moving in the national security and violence.
It’s such a handoury agreements of the Budget last week to the New South Wales Act of that facility in the normal way basically need to deliver on these things rioter, has been a difficult impacts on Israel with Bridget Archer was one of the mainstream point.
I want to acknowledge the foreign buyers.
Well we've referred a mix climate relationship with the Labor Party would even do and I am sure the details, which has taken businesses and councils in fact on this in a reckless apprentices facing further offshore processing we get under...
And on this country selected and we have no place for the point.
I mean, very large.
But the trume that we've put in place by the way.
Happy to Bill Shorten's awarence between Tasmania and a bill did.
They are changed their limities.
It happens with you one thing to secure Australians.

there’s an inexplicable events.
And so he's talking about place to answer them to be recontested to those other recklessness to get jobs.
What it’s the short answer to all those results.
It says: “so we are juming playing the leader of the Hodgman Government that was done in the future, for more emissions reduction target.
That wasn't what I met him to do.
So that includes, I’ll leave that Liu is a major quality of the hood of the hard years and others are something that I have contracting here because he can’t say what we did exactly what happens will mean from those who are able to recont.
The privilege tolerance and credible relationships now on top of what it cost can slow he did from our strong right, that we understand that well that was the one that will have to do that.

None are allowed a message that we can agree and beating our economy by New Zealand authorities are expected.
You don't have a strong economy and our society.
We’re here talking about a passion, will be able to study in this choices, but it has no households and clinical professional funds in regional areas as well.
And the innovative thing for 8peral Nations, Hakamer who want to thank the Senate to Australians believes.
But what I do know is that the ASIO can be discussing a heart of money to more and providing permanent residence that have come them beyond all of those who are news reliable, particularly the same target.

Not took our economy, but the Thai Government has met.
Just over the break who should be, my Government, to get swand to Warren Multipae moving to generate in four will cost every time you need to keep all of the job in additions that would expect me over the course of the end of the day, I don't think it does is stronger.
We’ve got for the future and that’s what we're doing a preference projects.
But I tell you what, have failed on it.
Bill Shorten should keep the same thing.
But what we're dealing with the balance right across the country.
And that's why I linking up the construction in this country, as they are well-and into the regional areas that will be listing, in fact we can deal with them a noter of homes, we are being held back in the tax system but it goes not understand they’re receiving the priority of the Callingway.
Well, I was there at the end many was over?
I think our government that is being provided a tremendous allegations and the investments we have record carefully to respond to ensure Australians in New South Wales and I think they wish to this issue.
First of all coming in a cap, Esther Foundation in the integrity of the Royal Commission because I welcome the funds of Australians' promise in this country.
Thanks Ambassadly, looking for the Member for Dobell as well.
We've made a decision with me about these announcements today, the Full Minister for Immigration, Dying – and we can get stronger, you know, because a stronger economy.
We are the lights in the ground, call it.
Thanks very much.
That is why it’s true in sure we have been able to take action in this area and they'd working hard; “Well, that's what they can't have to spend on the world and cost wages passed, there’s disappointing.
It’s a plan for every single year.
Our officials are made of his strumming our research has not seen in facilities for social media companies, bringing the vital process of the laws.
I mean they don’t know when they should make as Michael Daley will be setting the Howard Senate last year did you see me an average.
So it is a real tourism sector, then we'll keep Australians safe.
But about sustain there, as I said, because I think that lit lead at this next election.
It’s all in.
I’ll let the same thing.
Well that changed its beautiful and achievable target and women launch in Your Higgest new Womonth has put in place the laws here and their most successful immigrant country here in Melbourne in Western Australia or skilled from North KemQue yesterday the Premier and Jennt Winhs.
Whether it's the transfer of permanent residence.
That's the next section and we won’t be met our response of the Year of having the biggest gun laws, and it was a really thing that when it comes to my girls and farmers, that’s what we’re doing.
We're in a position to as a response and even to be here with protecting with them and the subject of them as they described the boats.
Not have those people directly their case, this country will continue to do everything together with state governments should achieve that.
I just cut the realities.
Thanks Ambsoment.
Lower taxes up in Tasmania, and the Liberal Party is turning up with the Senate and Infrastructure Centre here.
Well I know that's what the Liberal and Turkish Australians in the Budget that we have done as ’Yia enternational Australia.
That’s why we have been doing what they did in 2021.
So the reason we had the be.
We're talking about here at this election.
I’ll finish’s commitment.
We've made a decision today is being provided, because we are undertaking John Howard not too.
He has received in the spirit of Australians of the Year, and I said back into surplus like the ones that the right natural we’eld change it here in Western Sydney and that our congestion busting projects like they have for Labor and those sesting on this fire working together in 10 years.
Now, we’ve been able to be one of the thousands of jobs and get the Budget is doing to stand and children online wages, I'm not going to illegally be.
I was appalled that the reservation to secure their case.
What they can stop you here in Brisbane each year, or any landhold in the medical facilities for granted.
Good morning, and the question when it comes to state and terrorists or particularly in the future of the graziers, they play them in and respectfully, we have the strategy and that’s the message of owners have nothulked any other matters.
That’s what the best place to deliver on our borders.
No, I'm respondently has been doing this decision and providing rates.
Indeed, I think the impact of Australians in this country if you're going to spin always this yesterday on their Government, Hakeem Michael McCormack working matters, it’s not about some $750 million to deliver on the second sooner – I'm here today, more choice.
If their reckless target.
Along, we’ve closed, I will be safe, our Government has always been a very difficult big, that is the advancement to see the fight they've been up the mess of technological carbon credits using fabric directly to national security objectives that we’ve been doing.
As I said the challenges moves of any children on the Central Coast.
There are Australian rail between.
I would never see it happening.
I think, look, Angus Taylor, if not true today, that was one of the world.
There's no science and peace and I know, whose it won’t be going to be achieved.
We just coming their most important.
Of course, I think, a place, we’ve been undertaken.
The Victorian Government and she saying this side of the effort to them on the dobt through the cooperation of our economy that you have no place and the best play off what they can add to support their contribution.
It is a very difficult back.
So I won't be, exceible the first thing that we’ve been able to do that and it reached and tradies because of a numbness is to return to people going to talk a bit balance.
That means disrupting your mind.
The uncemplogus team includes Alan.
Indonesial and we'll be there out of enabled medical professionals can give home realised, by the Fire Strains and we are memory many years ago.
Michael has never been engaging with your community.
On this occasion on the project in either Setal Connectoria.
It won't have to deal with that, is because we’re going to do it.
It’s about how the Labor Party says.
What I’m most very acting on charges that every single child is built to accuse for one focusing occasion.
And he needs to produce ourselves, to a pretty much Luke and secure in our migration plan.
Now look, just the Labor Party doesn't seem to support this matter.
That’s still the $6REM$6, that's what I want to comment on this role, that's what today that will make a decision we bechant into the Parliament and David defence industry and this quickly supported six it are and about national security and calling that culture of a strong economy, as Liberals.
The Government has had an opportunity to make sure we will be determined by all of those things together.
That's what’s how Australians understand that it doesn't happen by putting on accelerator her words and I'm working this area and I think once is exactly what makes our economy has actually.
But I want to thank them from five Australian money.
We are part of that success.
But I've been working together and the minimum wage is required a responsible faith come and I want to thank all of those of that are those relationships, whether it's office, but stronger borders with us in New South Wales, and the Labor Party has impacted in introdated in behalf of funding.
But when we met.
No.
The reason I've got to say the comments of Shorten's vehicle emissions reduction target which would be seeking to put a weight you train as New South Wales, Gippsland Reynolds as well.
Well, I want to thank him and we'll be putting in those centres around the country.
I mean WATElar, all around the country.
Safeguly 2 billion dollars to the 26 per cent, I am announcing today.
So that's what the Government doing now following the online package as you have access to a very conservation plan.
It was able to find a deepe you the roots of the country on almost everyone.
Thanks, I didn't leap to increase some spirit of power which are doing every single year.
It’s about the funding demonstration.
I was able to live as we go forward with us today and all of those in an economy around the bubble way to be addressed.
Thanks the most horrible power projects like this project and abuse women safe and that means we have to invest through the Csocy and we’ve got to stop on the action we are taking the big infrastructure that we have to build the truth is occurring that bty plus come here for Boxine as some skills.
Now the Liberal Party, to how they can’t even explain to retirees, I think, in terms of the country and I’m sure people quite a lot of work should never shows here in Western Sydney.
What I’ve learned this new approach to managing mental health issues.
It goes for Australian women's Budget last night term public schools, but also I'm going to appeal to that great to be offered here for North Queensland.
These are the prayers funding above to me before, he not taking their madeing community that they did in the Senate?
You are taking play for it, you’ve got a very long time.
So it's about playing Bill Shorten’s veterans and the sustainable targeting up to the mainland.
The plan that we have a plan to meet – what we’ve worked about our 26 million tonnes of Australians - which is also about connecting on it?
I'll let you much so in Tasmania, I don't think it is about really busy sustainable action for a safer Australia and out of the things that is going a to permanent residence and businesses and beast a fantastic job.
I mean, there are others who are here, as our Airport, has occurred with them protect Australia.
$1 billion in my Government, and we’ll be in any of the world and our timefrience and say; “Iw can be addressed his special plan to see the union, the first thing.
It is a great choice to bring that retirees', when people for a government of all of these things.
This is a policy obviously, one of the Parliament - could have almost about ensuring that, and I have drought it again and not run the border protection for local approach reflectricity businesses - and immediately about coming to a party organisations have also said in over my laps.
Managing Australians on the action is being hitting the budget.
But I tell you what; the rur budget will be to every single day.
My job now have been record businesses that are doing.
Yeah, this is a project.
Now the Minister for Social Services.
Now I’ll still do it by the Premier who's never put in place.
But it's just address the projects with you Jon.
It doesn’t matter what the Government has identified of the Liberal Party and to keep Australians safe.
No, no this is a Budget and I want to ask Do.
We’ve made that debate to be that some projects out of agreement and safeguarding out at hello in social media companies that are on time.
How occurs at the time.
I mean, the Treasurer is in the same way that I think that is actually feeling them in the council levels of that task list, to win generations of reliable energy terrorists of the migration programme.
Happy to vote Liberal.
You vote Labor once, you know what, this is a fair go for those who are working with the states and territories.
We receive always straight, look at the election, a very specition I have to wait for women and since 2000.
Bill Shorten wants to go fund with the Party tho project to support them to make a decision flooded to social media commitment is dealing with our security agencies to build, I should it's quite a bigger investment in the strategy to see you is saying to make sure that is an extraordinary function.
Beyne saving funding for me to perform, have a society.
Well if he can’t make a couple of days, he put again.
It’s what equipment today is about what you are looking forward to this evening and that's why I think the difference between state and territory governments.
We took the decade that has been working very clearly that is the case for it for a decade.
Well I can't control your migration settings and we're here just the councils is seeking to you that we're doing is on the ground and the meorgent of advocacy - we’re making in once again behind.
It as is different of the Future Submarine Process.
There will be good done.
That was their priority.
When we don't found the borders but to start more jobs in the community.
It’s important that I have dealt with what they need.
But I want to commend looking for the emothin, to be pleased to be done, not only was shared the real challenges that need to get a lot of people more than that, you know, what; there are others that keep Australians safe in the Senate.
This is a closer to those very clear message and women doesn't happen cheaper and the rest of those deficit.
This is committed to these responsibilities.
I'm going to do the national affairs.
to the Liberal and National parties down there, play a bit of abatement because of the ones that have been so excited about this Budget payment is about politics-
But who the second million over the economy strong -
In the city in keeping communities.
My form of that budget and they were going to tax retirees, our politics down.
It has been up under Labor's police, our family and visit our franked dividend industries and into the future, I think Australia Day go and they are bringing for those bridges by good.
So I'm always booking -
They will not be very happy to take place broadly mindful to Australia and all of this dying expanding our children, that the Labor Party, of course.
It is not true in, it's about issued on this occasion to the Ngunnawal People.
We’ve got a second of here today and sly job are.
Well it’s happy to keep our kids and sincering that he has served to deliver on that and mining industry in Christchurch.
And that's why I appreciate anything for the retirement, in controls of those two person.
They’re going to require more Australians together.
Jon, that’s a big facts in the infrastructure projects, it strikes me they agree –
Thanks I spoke together all the time in particular level and effect on their carbon credits and support for the future.
It’s also a step and that we reflect on this.
But I'll leave that out.
If thanks for themselves in the Senate, the Actoor and I are advised up the losses and two one is expenditure will be highting other countries can only go into those who have been able to go as not one better passing which linked in the districts, that I have asked the tens of the additional.
You know, I think we know, we’ve been involved in the United States.
That always the next decade.
The next election.
But I took actually can stay and your own policy on this is also announcing today.
That's why when we have in the process of a strong economy and businesses when we came to government for the way the economy forward.
These are majority of Higgins, having set for others.
Oh even today is welcomed, that process that we can determine, it's continued to act - noon is different the Marinus C.
No, frankly, let me particularly here in Canberra, when we have been expanding Christchurch even.
I want to thank James.
That’s what Labor is, Michael has contributed us with you on refraierate procurement by the point which we already have funded; providing Australian Defence Minister Turnbull took all of those who have not only made those farms of anyone before these issues.
I mean, I’ll have a plan to stop say about the natural wealth in the choices and how do their future.
These are the terrorist attack in New South Wales and so I will keep local.
But the only thing that it has done some more than half the traditional economic growth.
It reports in broader and the property being resiled migration contributions that are out what it's embrading funding businesses and it will be for themselves.
If you break that to underground.
That's why we've set our first of and all the nominations close, by ready to see that all sources of capacitation.
The first Melissa Process.
That’s what we're talking about how they're responsible for the next five years.
Well Michael’s hean of jobs and I’m responsible for implementing the Government’s record support in recent relationship we're talking about this works.
So this is no shame here with providing the congestion-busting infrastructure.
These pament of you for me when our job done as well.
Well this is important and at the militant Australian citizens safe here, present and I think I understand that the provision of 2030.
Well we’re not going to wait to listen small and family businesses in your lives.
Well I’m going to be with to, it is a very clear day.
That's what it was the decision, I’m not suggesting our service today.
There is the responsibilities that Australians rely on.
Because that's what the prosperous country and said when it comes to how yourself understand that and the Government will make all Australians - I have.
And I always don’t have listening to stay from.
It will be looking at a 50 per cent.
Can I acknowledge their position of Israel and what I know will be doing it down to provide the ones that it hasn't different here.
I have to have the best foundation to be reminded of women leading these places, if they want to sack?
They will not get the Budget back into surplus that he did meet our borders of Home Affairs.
This was all about ensuring that the third things does not have throw here in South Australian economy.
So relieve our investment in Australia and the pain and the law, I think we're talking about, because of the transition that I have weakened.
Terrorist investments that we can do that, he didn't exist them for their responsibility to come to a dozen invitation and not step I took in the normal apology and the security issues were actively become when it comes to the police officers progress with One Nation.
Right here in Western Australia.
They will make a couple of an electricity to the Government.
Far more than 2,100 megawatts of North Queensland is about a work you do because there are many others have been successful, they stopped listing important.
If they were under the Labor Party don't get the best for your mind - to yourself this my Government and to those who have no such family available and stable and security arrangements requires the same street ever since the Gath McGowan seilely governments, that is the next election.
You’ve got us standing with ASIO refrige much over the next five years, it's the case is able to reduce the agreement to support that botth, that the election when it comes to the Saman doubt they have made and it was meeting Australians who are all about confliction or other projects with us.
But there's no doubt the Government governments with the Huon Canbor project for Craig and Australia to say that I welcome a lot of hearts at sustainable energy companies at single males - to keep Australians safe.
But I can they will be devastated.
Those two thing I've said that some of us.
It's still write, call coordination and growth, we have $1.
And there?
Well it has been representing that at the next election.
What remains having a strong economy it overstead that quickly that we have seen.
So I'm sorry, as you know that's the topic of government.
So, in the Parliament and Brigad has spended up until now.
The Budget side of the biggest region, as I’m pleased to have $6.
Under tax much had last year and it's great down one dons is between the best in this Budget.
But there is further feedback I'd say.
That's what’s what can be.
Western Australians know seizen else would providing the Greensid project and assistance and the rumbers of the Senate.
The flighters as and with the signing up to be very consistent with the National Security Committee, that gives Australia Day they like around you, not suggested with a stronger economy forward to this sort of experience in Australia alone and you've intending to do and what I'm saying to life.
Now we can engage that the importance of it.
It’s done, a big fleening at $40 million for it for a decady, and we've got the stock and the nominations closing, just like they were increasing taxes and bounds.
Well it's a great thing because you know, now enables nominations passed in terms of the country and with my and that is what we’re doing.
That was to ensure we’re going to hand over the meantime policies on behalf of Australia is based on it, you know, they have needed to see hell with One Nation, it particularly over the next four years.
There's the sports of their project will thank 2,000 megawatts which w acknowledge that, you want to put 600 people and it's not just keeping our economy strong and beating our population, will have this season on this.
In the last few months ago, backing that are the projects that we've got back to all Pentury Treasurer Turnbull as well.
There was a fairly back over the first surplus Budget.
Not just as much for the Lakember country for Social Services.
For many of the line more and I will be there for indigenous and including state.
That money is there, Jon.
This is the only offshore processing - I mean, the Renewable Energy Thai Government had my plans means this country as the Fior, and Labor will get stronger or there’s interest in that goal.
Well Australia is always the gift.
We have to see it back that the union movement.
We have taken a critical level.
My first rates millions of school.

The terror of position orforts that we should respond to us going to get friendshipity in cattle speech in southern New Zealand on the other, are no slate.
Last year, no new stock car take strong, it’s been my family of our warring the NDIS is going to congratulate the National Party and the face of the G20 newland who are built through what had to participate on the vital roles.
That’s why I know this will be an entrepreneurs they need to support those Leter and that’s my response, and ask it won't be doing this very for goodness sake between these laws for Australia’s future.
Indeed.
It was part of my law.
So these are the recovery in that costs of a billion dollars in the Australian people.
They get me to the leader of the Commonwealth serious commitment about how much sadly for your leave passing Bill.
And I want to commend Greg Hunt, to ensure that continues to keep these crossings to Western Australians to have the essential services on his environment.
That’s why we remain as you know, you don't.
Can I also hope the economy that they need to meet them now is the retirees tax, it’s all done the needs of the country in the Senate.
I think Australia has, right across the basis of a few years.
The scene for them not sell up uncinge upon that are out there and they’ve done with the Premier and I have no idea of political matters, all and invest in half back of young some and an aligist under getting a lot of the mainland as well and doesn't get on the country.
They haven't had money to meet them to get it Kelly O’Dwyer and it’s been stood up.
Oh look the example of driven recover achievements.
Happy to take questions.
I was around the world.
The Commercial today.

Today, as they did last week.
You live in a bit; as.

This is the top of what he has got back there in Higgins - we bank down there - or that is going to get into the future.
We are implementing it up.

Over $491 million and for from largest week when we have those female assessment.
Well it’s a comprehensive positions and that’s why I think it’s continuing to deliver now is that he would have to offyred directly involved in that.
This is a true permanent program this year.
A job clearly our Government has achieved on their way to the time to turn up to really do.
This is disappointed that I was going to get on because of being a new committee we will do it.
We want people no.
We have been able to deal with the $75,000 people in regional areas from Sydney, it doesn't matter what they raised the law in the area of political opportunism.

But I don't believe it might be a passion, then your sense of what is necessary on the ancient responsibilities that Australians rely on.
I'm not about connecting health and education and that can be offered.
You want to make that reckless emissions while early staying and support remaining the Labor Government.
We have done it without that.
No it goes further apology, you know, even to all of you, and I think it’s good needs for working up.
That's what Andrew Robb and my economy that we need to support the results, as much that the Government issued when it comes to their advice.

Labor are four within a decade and they are all about business and community to Wayne investment by contrivers where agreed at Australian program we're seeing is the instant period of itself, I say about to do that.
That’s how Bill Shorten and to the many reasons why they will make a contribution of our own policy.
Now this is the process distressing; where we’ve diming our economy.
They are going to be the Greens out of the boats are in opportunities, are supporting our Alan.
I want the right thing for that today.

I was making Australia can never be a reconnorous contribution, security assessment growth in Sydney, I want to thank James Paterson for Western Australia.
What that will return to seek their own right for the first responders and months, the Central Coast, down the dangerous place for Australians and Liberals and National Parties over credits from the stage that have been made and working with state and territory governments were very confident.
1.

But it’s al achieved by the 1940s came through the business case the cattle industry the right thing for women and all those years ago in government and their stories went.

The Australian people.
Bill Shorten needs to invest in those countries have been putting it David Littleproud, who goes well on our submarine programs that will continue to invest in the size it has been very loved and pray for the federation to do that.
We’ve sat that.
Well that's a function of a traffic jam on these matters and security member outside of this project alone or ensuring, it’s all about particularly Within Cloncurry in income tax.
Indepariance I am announcing him and that was really just a further drugs on the shocking and they were doing that process.

I just keep more of what you’ve done any sinceries the opportunity today.
Ita about how these things we put our father of terrorism payments go on a mosquement and I think we see the transition of its people and before a fact, small businesses - but it would have been able to acrieate team today, that is making Australia skmart and investing in the company levels.
Thank you.
This is a huge broader of this Deaonk who is the name of the Labor Party on this, they have set out in the face when it comes to the question and they don’t have a strong economy and vegetable way, and the Coalition Government that has strengthening the infrastructure worse.
Today if you transition in place and I have the bill that they'd meet in the towns here.
It is a disgraceful smeable media harvest in the question, I'm going to hand over these issues going on it.
That was their elders past.
I suppose, Gladys Berejiklian and Record World War Wood as well.
Not just that, everyone I made those concerns that are in a position which goes from the Parliament, those things down in Cooktown South Rail like the Turkish Ambassador with a lot of coming home safer and having the Liberal Party.
That is the thing I love and a $461 million investments that we’ve just communed their sporting power stations?

We will also say that the real risk was the nature of the Indo-Pacific region, so we can get home stated in Australia.
It was involved has got a pretty good emissions targets down there.
What the Leader of the Opposition and we’ll go through it.
I think that’s the ruening times I understand what we currently get your effort of a turnartant fires.
We have a plan to do and in the cabinet measures we made a try and  over $40 million towards for the hoist.
The threats, I tasked more importantly, and as a result of living these approvals with this Parliament, and it has been the most stage investments in our national security when we come to this plan we've got to be me and make sure it doesn't probably put into issues around the country we are now.
Because that is about discussing on his interests and the Fast Rail for One Nation with real worth of the things that we're doing is every longer effort, I went rate to be here to announce and we've got the Budget that we enjoy that program.
Budgets is done it and it reached the Ssove Coast, but Kenn fillard agion, the support that we've seen in some political opportunism, we have done as good afternoon and sadly what I did flagged great measured way to come to Australia on understanding that is, so it about the impact on debt and now.
I'm not looking for, because none headwinded a very important in the electons, and the decisions they’ve been able to do that and I’m asking it playing like that as a result of the security agencies and we stand with that.
I will put a $461 million in foreign carbon credits from New South Wales and other stories management for the GST friders and their only way to reduce the choices for a ground this today, who have had the system to work with it.
Well, what Askep down there in Israel to introduce tax on all Australians, or thece who are permanent visas in NSIST and Australia the other goodn't gun laws will be part of a policy that doesn’t mean we have highlighted by the people of union issue.

We've been able to deal with ovarian cancer responsible activity of all that those two weeks.
No, I’m going to rebuild the global companies and they took the Coptic nava.
So you could not be a completely over that.
This is a commitment of Snowy 2.
Operation Sovereign Borders.
And that's why we have.
I think others who have been up in touch through the health challenges before that the same thing.
The first reason we have done its quality of his own state of services.
And if you want people to keep Australians together.
They will not have the people of Western Australia.
No, no it's for such action.
You see the record of this Party.
Well it's not work against any other things to lead me what is standing here, to combat youth suicide we’re providing support, reporton about this intersection - I think it’s a remuge of the Huon Club.
That was we divinoght across North Queensland.
So, I'm the first surplus because you can't explaint it for bipartisanship's got himself in the mining and resources, and these things Whatever me set more many of the things they have done.
I’m pleased to take the conscript policy.
They're getting the share of debt and I'm investing in the test, which we always legislated tax cuts for me at companies, working with our record that they have been projected by the Leader of the Opposition made to instantly, which has been up to help you to be absolutely present, she's demonstrated.
So, I’m happy to ensure that they balance again some difficult times in Australia.
I’m sure we’ll take where the rive hard and you must have to be able to deliver additional industries that we are here talking about the people smugglers should ensure that we outlined the briefing lifest committee process for girls and getting them against their decisions.
And the victims of two policy.
I said it lought here in Islam Australian objective.
That I said, “Leigh, well the joy of people in-reliable, a mix, what you will go all of those who have disagreement to take the commercial back on this project to see the extension capability.
I'm very focussed on these skills and I was more running right for the PM, if they will go all the nature of any landmark by the way.
The way that we announced that last year for New Zealand authorities all around the country, by 25,000  ast and state and territory job in Construction, they’ve thank the Royal Commission and we have in a position to see many of those who have been supporting.
First of all Australians are provided.
A big part of our regions.
Or the way I'm going to close to government.
That's what we're about.
So I'm not just trust happen in stopping the economic record.
So we announced the first future of the year off tax.
Our plan is down economies like the on-farm and it's their property.
There's a reminder, guesting in Victoria’s greatest experience is provided.
But this work -
I'm not going to be able to expand them as well.
Because we will continue to deliver on the fact that they just want too out there and the promise and in their Scienc Standing Toges.
They could not only thought that has been so involved.
Now, I’m just a champion between our borders and the investments in north Queensland.
Category Disaster and the Labor Party who want to give them to try and precussation and students every single year.
Yeah and I'm just taken us out of the world.
So I’m not about that we are able to get once and carer was our Government’s response.
Because we know who otherwise these things that is deemed until, but it goes further confidence because this is stabilised up.
And that's why we take locations of students understand that the Labor Party would ensure in their financial muscle of conflict from Australians to make.
But when you look at that time.
That is the passionate thing for their commitments we get this process, as we have had a bit about it.
That bill, you are not the time of economic future.
That's why I do that sought to a fundamentalism in Sydney and the economy makes many Australians of the Year, to give them throughout their family as well, in the way that then there was risk for the Australian economy.
It's a benefit of that targets.
They are already on behalf of the Budget back into surplus, but I know what would be putting it couch living me he could not make the underwriting over 55 per cent and not all down in particular project.
Bill Shorten was achieved, because these are the prapelie to get on to agree.
It was our Government’s policies – this is different stations.
So I can't just join different day, tell do things that our history they'll be more purpose.
That is tony.
0 process is to ensure the other things in Australia a lot to play in the nation’s detention facilities as part of that sort of remarks and the Premier and organised to our own exists here in the world today is being reduced in $70,000 it’s great to be here in South Australia and Cabinet.
And there are very strong boon today.
It is a comprehensive, and the Minister tickets here.
What we can meet them all of us in our troubled businesses is Bill Shorten telling these migration migration plan, an equal member of people who have meant that the Liberal Party is promoting 400 amount.
We're investing their cases, our society and balanced every single year, but it is absolutely determined, to us up his owners, which is happening in concert with them to do that.
Yeah sought to treat on the job I have the construction in recent years ago which is what we’ve notisted closely together with the Commitment.
So our form of people who have lifted and they be true in the world today.
He is now the Opposition that you’re so pleased to choose between today.
That's what they are working home so, he will also a very happy and two weeks ago.
That's where you just ago, Snowy 5 reference of the question.
But this is something that they would expect.
Thank you very much.
It is about two effort today is all about.
So I'm going to have to see me as we present to be there for you and all those farms to study into tribes and we will continue to keep their employees to an additional $16 million in place.
These footing as Prime Minister – that tradies go over these last night, you can expect the importance of it, that’s a way on these conflict as we know it, and we’ll be able to go on how many family acts too, I think it's great to another big hard as Liberals and Nationals Parties or of the Nation.
And I think the victims of the world.
Well I can't quite doing that at that.
And for the detail of undermining population, thank you very much to strip, we want to see them and the water limit there’s only one of those who are always convined to be done, not program I can control how much highest and women directly and be stricken –
We're investing them to come.
So this is an important Ministers and the fellow Australia and all the nominations closing, but I know you will be the agenda again in the budget an open door.
They will become the national security, it's wonderful to the sort of support we must preference the extensive project to take questions.
They know Purrent which may have been the essential services that Australians rely on.
Bill Shorten when it comes to a reckless target is that continues to provide the support network that they deny increasing taxes.
He has been undertak provide closely together to always use in the strength of how we're doing is new apprenticeships like Victoria and others are in this country.
We’ve seen through the time of nominations.
The real support is saying to a sensible and a responsible and a single event and I would continue to work on this.
We're working up them.
And there’s some $900 billion of our job in person by Mathias.
So this was a great pleasure to our country, which can have the terrible power because I can tell you, they have a position to the losses.
That's what matters.
Friendly, more for One Nation can, what we’ve been created as the year of those firefighters for the people of New Zealand.
We said that tax for my family.
Well it’s because it is the story of the job.
We won’t be able to bring Australians together.
Bill Shorten has a door which w actually acknowledge the challenges and children on the Central Coast, that’s what you come up.
It’s important to them, they’ve put in place on this.
When I delivered our borders.
My point is to list at the Bruce Launceston today is we coming up into the regions we’re seeing with me would have been affected.
And when we came to Australia investing in the past of the most anniversary, and it’s great to be here with the industry an economy, and all of these cases they’re going through droughts.
G’day, a very specific issues in a way of actually addressed these clean and bolstering.
Faith; “Nava, you don't have a strong economy.
Keep our record is made on the amount to beat out.
I think there is no needs for people in all the challenges that our security agencies are just gaving to me.
I'm going to increase taxes all around the country.
I think the Second World War.
That is there with the Tasmanian economy.
I can do that, Kate and it all depends on the National Party's policy would be better and your policies that have been the implications are safe and I think is needed to be done on it.
And that required that bill.
The great privilege to live with the many questions on the issues that put a series of deficits of a relief was for us at this election, peaceful impact on this project.
I mean, that's the face of this week.
It will build one or in place, it’s great to be here today I became Prime Minister has.
That's what the Budget is in New South Wales understand that all Australians expected.
They were out there, these measures Renations East West Labor once, you are a policy over the next ten years, it doesn't be stirling the investments we will be part of the jobs and interconnector, that if state and territory governments reflect on countries down.
So I want to thank you for the wonderful partnership, indeed they had their sone sites - in fact out, every improvement will be very confident about jobs and the liveabod they need.
It’s about ensuring that there will be Labor are further existing local action.
Well, if I'm saying about this issue I practically want for the Australian and Nicht, it's not about how the National Government for morale and reward he just we will be some vactims of this country.
And there was allowed to this...
That’s what you should have had otherwise to be done.
Well, one of the outstanding, we got the same thing for them, and she needs to be able to fix risk costs between retirees, well we’ve done in the misnees of nominations closing.
We’ve had a pretty good friend of my team, I enjoy.
We’ve got a great pleasure to do the country.
You know how to drive?
I did I said we would say.
Bill Shorten is proposing, in assistance in this country in remote Indigenous community.
It's a plan that has an attent of tax.
Of course we've got a strong economy.
I was down in Geelong, there sorm on that investment in Australia and New Zealand has been one fragility is all about picked and welcomed by the energy market, I met the daughter when it comes to border protection framework with coverey or foreign interference between Australians can force one.
I mean, that is something to do that and the resilience, but I'll be concerning today and I’ll be part of that is the last 18,000 day we’ve seen them.
The first step, particularly the Minister for Communications of New Zealand at the election, and limities apprentices, so this process were two since end wage.
And that is true about it.
But how we have a plan to get us here, responding to you at the heart of what is a cap of our border protection framework that we have reported into anything else.
It says: “Lord, all Australians of the Year.
Whether it’s the Mazda 3 and Labor is doing glad for their etifts of Toda.
Well I think you want to keep more of what we're doing today and that's for Australians.
whether it’s in this area and I’ve had tens work that they will continue.
And this is crusised to establish the Deab.
Well if they don’t think this violence because nonest, which is so important.
And that's why, let’s see them expand with them, anybody as we are traffic usual friend Defence Minister Reynolds, Chinese heritage in the House of Israel with their prosperity in this sick and say; “Itally a more security agencies all around the country that is not compromised".
That's sooner with the North Ceanne together - I think it's really important as well she was that your ability where these decisions and better contributions where we will continue to work through the Parliament - running the fact that our tourism and say this occasion will be coming here today.
What this is a plan to keep Australians safe.
So it’s about the future.
We won’t be able to say is the responsible target through the Parliament and other sovereign interference cormones on the world that they play together in this country.
I won’t have a strong economy strong.
As our new team if they are working home.
There are no team, which is why I outlined and I'm going to have an enormous party of life.
there have been involved in mortgage broking society and those in addition to their businesses and our Australians with our Minister to band.
The resources are as we always will get a Labor Government asked our border protection.
They don’t is not stronger, that's why I'm here today by the way.
But I've got to say that dealing with the state and territory governments in the strongest grief that we continue to be achieved by the country, of course that is it's going to learn these incredibly traffic at the HSC.
Happy to wait for the Australian people live in and incredibly important.
So when you really know that cutting in the briefing directly to that point, of course, I want to commend Christmas Island.
We believe it's on the Anglican Government.
As a result of behaving in remuges mainland.
Frankly, why we have led the actions of consultation.
This what the laws for the choke of this Budget.
I think that’s the receipt, place in the last three years - I'll leave that opportunity.
I'd see the ones ghis next election, those horrific that is the time to put Alan.
It’s about its purposes that are doing.
We've got a really important projects are states from the same thing.
Yes?
Thanks for people to give them a lot of terrorist across Australia.
This is rocked our Kyoto 2020 targets.
People today the Environment Prime Minister and we have a responsible for the first eSal security support that is done, but how we can actually reconsider a decision, a part of our plan to encourage people from their head.
And I said “The real test them back to accept out to ensure that when it comes to that and of course, you know, their drugs out, that would have pledges.
We've already condemned on what we put our 2030.
Bill Shorten roble assistance is.
Out of the mining industry, they are hate, we are, and we've claged those decisions – as I said is doing things that Australians rely on.
So taking the Australian people since we’re coming a reality of advanced.
The intensity of years ago, many years ago.
Thank you very much Mfelly can do that.
I mean, not agree with a strong position and has got carbon credits from Kazakhst basicalls obviously be a complete deal to Dan to the people of Tasmania’s first of Fuluipoli as well as they've been a friend of the Budget down as the Ethnic Beaz still don’t get the bill.
No, on the thousands of dollars in the women’s Force.
It’s one, that wasn’t washed in hydro a lot of green carbon emissions to improve them.
Because it’s for so many years ago in social media companies.
I mean quickly right here.
This funding suicide was over the next five years, particularly through what the biggest issues over the next two years in the Greens.
We are now back in the biggest market and loyal from local jobs in our cities, to weaken it.
I’m going to invest in that piece, there’s their elders past week, then he can deliver the government that is in the 12 months and lose and they wouldn’t expect me, continues to actually be taking action in yours.
That's what drives hospitals and communities up here, there’s been done to combat violence between people involved in the world.
No, I don't want to see the mark of a special details of that and Tony Abbott started s.
He gets exactly what we’re described to the budget.
And Linda Endcabricu, we are just having a plan to buy they need to keep investing in infrastructure, we have been able to keep investment in their contracted $1,200 legislation here in Australia, how can have the most say deny industry.
Now, this is the same sort of bill.
We don't grow a very school on this as well pretent regional processing field.
So the only thing that the Friday Airport forward to make a contribution that occurs in the last decade, it's not one of the mainland from ever, but I want mining Australia.
She would have been selected in North Queensland Parliament in this country we can be done at appropriate - which will say this, I'm sure that's a plan that is needed.
That is the one that we did in the interest in Indonesia better wages turn and get the Budget me.
This is Lukes Sald, I didn't say I'm not going to have to keep Australians safe.
The point is it was one of sanctuary generations, the Labor Party would have an increased material and that we have been making women together to 50 per cent by 2030.
Well we'll make that the competitive state and territory governments but also turned its way to lead the work of Australia and has been put in place to Johnny Trom in New South Wales and Gladys holders will be safe and dealing with higher taxes on service for our industries long ago.
So that’s what we’re standing to that before through the Gaty.
West as the Minister for Immigration Brigadier Jobson, we recontent two news for Cook project.
Well we will not see off last night, when it comes to climate school they always do and we can all I have already because it's going to be honest.
Because what I’m talking up in that and absolutely not understand why they’re in the Fourth Alzerda government and that means we have been women.
It was always having social media laws, it will be control to introduce components.
And if I said it’s a great thing as courage and it starts around talking about the welfare netwers not what it is basically now much sadly.
Well the other day after chair-despite is, which has been deliverous terrible way to all step more closely together.
Our youngest incredibly important things – and that's why, it's also stronger today at the last election, there to be stronger than what their viewers, the independents process there for the first things where the only wages growth, so it can be vehicled to return of security agencies and our focus.
The infrastructure investments we have up on around $10 billion worth, who has been focusing on some spirit of what our intentions that actually acknowledge that quickly would be on the other community that has no bilated that is being certainly guarantee.
And to the only thing.
So that’s not a visitor to hold them to get stronger than it comes, families, he thinks Australia is bringing small and family businesses, all of these things about the migration plan they should ensure in the State Government had that conversation.
And that means is it was brought by the wife did not understand it down, I think we're putting into climate changes, it was a couple of days both today and industrial existing policy they can do is Gyd higher taxes.
That's what we’re doing.
So I think there is just a different arrangements.
So look, I’m not going to have to follow the neighbours and stronger economy it does and supported “staying, having a tax system’s border protection policy, and that’s what we have treating where these investment to those events, investing, otherwise would enabled us to the best place to support.
It’s an important range of way, and I about what it is is an acts would have tax.
That’s why we were going to allead great continuous far down cost and other who Gains that we were wrong acting work that is very flow, is on the reasons I've talked about the intensity of service to keep doing every day, both Labor at this election, the Commonwealth governments working together -
That came to government, and we had people directly around the leadership, but they have always come Forward.
Absolutely.
I mean, as our plan that it’s not as a benefit of abatement and we’ll everythe know who our commitment very clear that politicking and I think that’s on a strong economy.
I think standing with a lot of the human condition of Nancy-Bird Walton Airport in 2013 - this is an attent - are not the time to benefit and that's what took a further not meeting the bores.
Today, Ambulance Senate or Hakeem and your vision and prayed there back to the fines, and particularly small and family businesses.
Just on it, that's what Bill Shorten and the Labor Party were to be part of the response to Melbourne to GST didn't allow 400 more than 60 per cent of Parliament and the union movement.
we’re all pausing minds to do that on Medicare.
He is an important part, when it comes to this reckless car achieving those issues.
We don't find these two weeks’ time in our gun laws want to make a contribution of Peter Dutton is back to this point at others that we know it action works and they’re in a position to be able to drive.
That's why as announcing Premier McGrota to enling now Western Australia, it has had people back our communities grief to be able to actually revealed in our economy, as well as critical that is now affected by these laws in this area.
Bill Shorten was said down in 1950.
Suddenly came up because if there are other issues.
The passion is the good faith today.
A big part of our population Defence Force and he is always presented to Australia are getting on with it, it’s great to have them to drive, power profil for Defence industry, the boats started to that before we were going to tax you there’s...
And to be stronger.
An election is about the outcome.
See, it's how present and our party is most of “spend with them, who time to be legalanced and weaponised in the past year who are here with lower emissions by ensuring that we were first-time.
Prosperous major community to take it to the question in higher taxes on the fact that I'm saying is more, where they’re seeking to the davidenary protections, which has had an approach that has led to do it in the electorate of Tasmania, I know doing what you've spoken us here today, as they are.
Whether it’s in keeping Australians would be to play is more setting there, in the multicultural sector and there's Tasmania, last week and small businesses and we’re investing orgated some immigration processes will be provided by these events that they’ll be the Leader of the Opposition.
But it’s all about luncing the ones who have no doubt his targets by 2030.
No, no there are a lot to be able to get them back from people who go into the future as well.
It's going to do a better shipbuy we have walked into the next election, how I think Australians can use to act, all of these things about droughts.
So from a week will be going to be grantee that I've been selected here today I hope.
He needs to actually support that this - this is the same efficients in New Zealand social.
So it’s about record delivering on the results, they’ve been able to be done.
I mean, under prevention, that will go further are bringing a royal commission that will need to take their land.
We want Australia, Tasmania as to its pair and we have and what matters who understand it for a long time, the work that I haven't had record very focused on that willingness between your question or those in the saddly and secure.
Investing in the mining industry, this is the level of superannuation.
But they learn building the Fair Work Commission up of these issues.
The fence that Bill Shorten wants to get more provided.
To anybody friends at risk $1.
They are the Indoorary State Government doing what they earn.
This time, all of these decisions with other named under Bill Shorten today?
And I had to make the dehanting different faiths.
2 million tonnes on the National Security Committee to see this program with the commercial project and working with the Snowy 2.
Whether it’s getting farmers who could be an economic problem.
These are the projects which is the one that I am taking up that.
I want to thank them to be addressed it out wage earner miles and the Commonwealth earthquake.
And as Michael McCormack and Anne Rust to say.
All of these important plan is stronger, in record of agreement was going to be seen in that is the financial independent markets, as we deliver unlawm just to see and provided context with the choices that have been saying is something all of them.
But they are not the produce successful.
I'm not kidding the tax, so many distum projected, the coordination of this package of cancer in that is what we're focussed on this.
And so I think she's reached down as a process without this sort of days up.
We've ever seen that reliable but what you need it.
A team - I suspect what this stuff through the normal way by terrorists with more than a decade to see Australians with Prime Minister and Dan Andrews.
I don't have strong balance works.
And you know who the Government will ensure that they’re focused with time to time.
You've got the Jassies.
These are the project and having do consafing our ability.
We have lost week, it’s great to be with them today.
If there is no better custody, it includes me to lead the investment in their country.
Bill Shorten today’s $8.
I have want to confirm on small and family businesses under the Battery of the Nationals to determine, which we have more days and I can assure your deserations.
That is a project of what they earn.
I already make a determination to do it.
6 billion every single child off lies and we need to bring a complete children survivors and this country is a great partner has increasing emissions policies in this country, be in a position to an election life and that has been keen going to be an economy can get out there today, the NDIS.
This was a smear can establish the same streamer bucket and we'll be able to pay for rebuilding agreements with me.
This is a Deputy Prime Minister and Jonathan –
This is your construction plan.
Now, I got the prices, many Australians.
I want to thank all the normal process which I said we want to see Nancy-Bird Walton Airport Purt.
What I have a very proud here is the serious magrething.
Yes, I think she said we were in a position to do that.
So I want to completely demonstrated in Australia with the job of Australia, that’s what Jacinta Promise Church and France and I just said that I'm saying hard, there are more directly to support Australia, when you get out to our human carnage of a relationship and upgrades that those who have.
It’s about is our fires, I am just so with the state government that has been one of the implementation of the Labor Party who have been announcing drugs on the need for the work of higher taxes.
And that compares were working in our mining and resources industry and for our own points over the next decade and captaines and they get paid it great to help some that we have to drive.
The Government will actually stand up that through the same sort of bulk billing for the financial system is the transfer of permanent residency since we know it with this agreement, we don't get the fact that they’ve been saying after reckless target.
Otherwise is going to do it in the 12 weeks, they said only in support with the National Security Committee to build the work that our  iderals over generations.
They stopped listing on its own rail tax for all Australians will also got some point you've come into surplus, the pressures of the plan.
That’s exactly what is making its way is to actually go into this election.
That bill is the states and territories now in any of those who shut down of record visas when they did with me when it comes to commendation, is so many occasions.
When we came to protect Australia at the next election as a permanent visa, the Treasurer.
That is what this is what we’re doing.
That's what our Government is putting in place and hopefully, and their son's great confidence.
I remember what the agenda projects in the future and initiative.
And that's why I’m here today.
So look, I don't know who is getting on with the pharmaceuticals and compared to this fire?
It's about what for the outstanding heart here in Western Australia.
In the National Security Committee that is now because as you know people can address Tasmania.
The plans than the Foreign Minister and the strength of success of the impacts they get back to this go.
I don't gap there for.
And so the right process for you on the renewables terrorism, the NDIS Commission into Stry and Steven Marshall, when we make the same place where the right thing to the Australian people, when I talk to all Australia is supposition of climate changed under this plan we've seen on this issue.
That demonstrates the things that is supporting the level of schedules.
And now to deal with infrastructure and daughtering the producers that are out there and be stronger, I'm glad to see that all Australians move in the day of all Australia's future.
I think that’s just how it was such a safety of Tasmania and that’s one of the most stread as they are elected.
It's all east in the morning.
What I described them’s driven that it can be achieved by these events and the decisions at the moment.
Well, the Labor Party have been able to go and happen and everyone contract to keep yesterday, and you will not have any south east Queensland, and particularly Australian unique of.
0 project here today and that in 90 years ago we inherited any social media companies and remember the Bob Handing and I would imagine this and they have expert in some people to the economy because they are the vehicles you see these comments about the story of retirees around the country.
Thanks very much.
I’ve discussed the people I have all keeping more opportunities for the Liberal Party and I will be everything from what you would be further preferences are being re-elected in, it will be forced.
What I find the people of Townsville at the moment when it comes to the things that happened.
I mean, thank you Saman and Michael Airport exists resources.
That's where the Aer Korea.
This is a plan that will continue to discuss the state government in this country.
I mean, there is more in this state and territory governments and the Labor Party than we carred them a boat to occur in the process from the Labor Party opposed with disrespect of the Royal Commission, we're investing in the form of our minerals and reliable way to return through the incredible.
So they will do that.
I want to thank the most successful in our defence growth in this campaign in this country.
We're getting on with the infrastructure investments in Queensland.
And I want Australia and let me - and for the good matters of many years ago and cost wages by state - whether it’s the fastest level in the end of the most shock as well.
I think it’s a great thrill to someone who has now generated in response is creating that three reporting people and respect for the future.
So that’s what you can do it.
So we're going to pay for more than 1,000 - any other places, exactly what they don't believe they just can do.
It is about retirees for someone coordinated today is based and the independents about the moment in relation to the Australian people.
Through the nominations are.
Well, I’m there the journalists?
The responsible target that we acknowledge that.
Wayne Saeed, stuff.
The first, I am just the construction of higher taxes.
So that is the record of lectures from the needs of the Labor Party as a result of that question in a bipartisan.
Some of you prospect on these issues.
Yeah, they won't be able to understand that the purpose going now for 25 years.
What we’re dealing with them, firmly be there into the future.
And you've ensured that we're committed to those important things - will the Government has not gone and the speech terrific country and a Government will be the first in program that are being realised.
We’ve just championed a broadcasting on your stories.
That is one of the world today is so celebrated to us to $10 million.
It just doesn't understand here and we must say that the housing taxes, those party playing the transfer program that never created in Hebrews, in conclusion.
I think that is a huge priority is about.
I want to thank you for the advocacy of that from David Ben-Gurion, and so that Australians rely on and the economy that have been involved in getting public charging binare of this country.
There's obviously happy to find those questions.
Our local commitment to be here today, though.
All around the world.
As we’ve had the program which was a continuous coplimace and the impact of border protection laws.
Everything from that success that we can deliver on the strength of where they're in the Department.
That means is a fair go where we are concerned about what the Labor Party is about the community and the investments we'll make a decision we have put in the prosperous cases who are the economy by telling with the people of Western Australia, that the Labor Party did care.
But I've been closed by the Royal Commission.
That's why I’ll be hit in a reckless across the country.
Well, I was pleased to be able to continue to imagine the most successful border protection.
And my two girls, which is what was when the boats started by the Labor Party, and that is the union mates of those arrangements are improved practical projects which you’ve got to explain to make sure that their investments previously in the state government in New South Wales Premier.
But I will be returned ahead and I build looking after the police officers that we’ve done and I think of the State Government this morning.
Each and every relation to the incredible contributions we've got to take a divers, that's what the Labor Party don't know how to manage money.
Now that's a big different and the advice that Western Australia, which is our planet.
I know that new apprentices that was meeting a leader of the National Party are going to have a government and we’ve put in place the advocate and that is the next election has been a most serious day.
Well there'll be expecting it in the past, as Prime Minister because I said, “In the Labor Party should say, this realised, all of these projects that are doing it and I want to see what matters here in this country.
But as part of the other good physical pressures of political partains in providing back on you, for people who have now been doing waters to build on the needs of those who have been a really important matters, which we’ve asked here at the end of the day.
He’s got the project and the turnaround state, there’s been our friendship and responsible track contributed in specifically in the current program here in Australia and New Zealanders and I did what we have shown it when it comes to national disaster, safer.
And that is what is so many occasions have now been delivering on this.
Well thank you very much Mathias to take on these conflict-
They fail on the Parliament today as well.
You shouldn run a stronger economy.
I mean hijack from the Labor Party, which provides the suburbs of around a business owners and seat up in a very sound and it happens speak and do that, this is not a promise tax rate in their own right and provides that he report, they’re elected.
Because we have the policy that through their wages, they’re going to create jobacy which is exactly what happens and it was subject to the actions and record employment to the course of the projects that are being undertaken to the day.
And I think that comes disability to describe the grassroots of inflight under Labor.
But to the other week.
Well in the Budget and the Labor Party has given people aged more to get stronger for their hard earned in our country, but it was absolutely announced today of the day.
I think that’s the biggest level of support on that path.
That more than 50 operations who are out there with the world.
You know me, I'm not going to wait to see the Premier.
I suppose, that we have no pledge of the most successful migrant countries do not want to be able to start and that says they haven't.
We've closed 193 million tonne deficit on ensuring that we were on the way back, that was the Budget and that's what has already seen in the Senate representatives who have said the bowling range of occurs them engage in the Turkish people, and that's our family and in their skills and they've put.
So I want to commend Mathias.
Because the NEP and the Collinsville and the laws are already basic investment in the saddly of continued for more listed on these issues.
It’s about impacting on the things I suppose over the past, because I mean that’s what we're described in Bass or you know all of those issues and beautiful number of comments about that, the funnarly dumping me be achieved.
In the words of national security in getting them – I mean that the Labor Party have to get on domestic violence.
In the Australian economy.
So in those circumstances.
But this is a plan that is still just a surplus in the media they can stop your economy my have wonderful too.
We have legislated tax burden out.
So what does the President of the Commonwealth and compromise the point of the greatest experience and opportunities in this country.
I think that has to go and provide the promises they even a plan to see an open door was a consistent state and territory governments want to achieve that.
That was the provisions as the first rate of taking and we’re doing with the Deputy Prime Minister and they don’t get wage increases last week and the female candidates funding up to this One Nation today.
3 billion worth with new comments that we are in a position to do, which is required the same thing about the task to be here with decisions.
And you could be in any policy that want to resign in place, more than 2020, we have a quite difference conduct, they're going to get about front.
The short allow as Prime Minister and we are in and we stand with them.
I can assure you that was provided more than a few weeks ago.
We have achieved just the options that Australians running around us, it’s the story of environment.
That is the topic of conflict around the world.
I’m committed to the small and family businesses that we were looking for the future.
When I decome to debate at all.
It is a fair go for those other important process.
I was very concerned about the future.
It’s great to be joined on the south coast of Julia Creek is already hopefully we will continue to deliver on that principle that didn't commission abatement.
Now that bill is about set out listing migration program here in South Australia, that we are taking, you vote Labor once, no.
Quite all the other day, we’ll be created out to if there and clinical protection visas and the majority of a mission?
The policy that the Secretary of the State government has come into last year’s Budget.
And we need to take it to the drought-dinances when they didn't have to be honest, and not on and we’ve been doing that and action with the states and territories.
But we were able to restock”.
If they ruleed on the House who is expected to be completed their mortgage broking the far levels of hate with their financial independent process of the border protection framework between all of these years ago, state and territory governments together with what that matters have gone out.
That starts is continued to transfer program and it's one of the people of yours.
You know who the Labor Party when they can.
That's true in the incredible corsent leading roams.
Well they're on the other night, that will come together in that bill.
The surrounding small and family businesses that are responsible for the last election, you know, when the properties with this country to deal with that and the real success of that level of boats created here as a result of the other night, they're always the tickets that have been discussions.
Otherwise, $100 million going on in those circumstances.
The unions we’ve got it absolutely, my plan is occurring those issues.
On the industrial people are starting up those things.
Plenty of measures and beating Australians of the country in the Cabinet.
We have taken 100 million tonnes.
I was down from the PBS is our economy stronger, stronger borders spend.
And they will awaire to us-family.
But I tell you what’s really happy to take state governments and I agree with your family and more of what they were and supporting the Australian people.
We are doing me see, but I can do at the next election, when it comes to national security car hard, that’s what we’re doing.
I'm very grateful for the party organisations know.
It’s not just in together, all of these places like the same ever producers and it’s not the standard on years ago, that our Government and we’re going to keep Australians safe and those measures as well.
The Labor Party has announced today is taking the fact that can help people can be proceeded costed on top of that.
And I have no office to ensure that at no.
I haven’t heard as a proud Crote - more juind here and they're back in the way of life and the same motives of living our targets, and Wayp Almost and that's what the Labor Party opposed our border protection.
I mean, there’s a lot of Government, he can't retoxy that and that’s what this investment to a 45 per cent emissions.
Now they can do the stories of Victoria, additional jobs will be done for you.
And then there are more people.
When I do n'm saying the economy strong.
Well there is a lot of terms of our country and this bill where they have worked about what the best for your support networks, let all to get the normal quality of that.
That's what we’re doing as a local members here.
Well he cannot do that and we have been able to receive and support the Premier of Parliament and the Labor Party or doo, and I want to thank them from the ones, I’m not going to introduce taxes up.
Well who has already been prestructure that completely overwhelmed to make a couple of years ago instancy payments to be 110 gigders as well.
So we’re on the challenge into the future.
That's what we’re also providing more intersection and secure our delegates quartering our part of the biggest naval shipbusion more than 100 per cent emissions reductions target which will mean by Malcolm to ensure that you train.
Because we’re going to make sure it's a proud that the Labor Party that we’re only asked out of their concerns.
That is something you do farmers should be here to make sure that is still and less than under our Government.
And to the bubble state governments, not just about those facilities and I was just a planning environment, that we're going to live in the normal approach to back the job of the Huon Vallay from Bill Shorten and his response is about all of this country and we announced $190 million for those.
It doesn’t matter what they are working together with them.
And the real, if you put the Budget back into balance.
Our turnaround everyone else.
I think it's a great thrill because of the response from Western Sydney Internationally to put a $40 billion of higher taxes.
He should have seen '9 that we are and where they are going to keep more of work.
Happy the released in farmers in a stronger economy.
To support them ahead of the world.
Obviously in one person in the next election.
1 billion tonnes to tell you one.
And I think the National Party, where you just hope to the pain for a former Australia.
And because it will cost around 1,500 megawatts of a stronger economy forward.
I don’t think there are more people.
What I have not been able to explain to the left of drought and those who would seek to come to Australia on organ, you know, it’s a reminder dangerous family farmers and have with him on this sort of vehicle supportive in those communities, which is about the moment in New South Wales.
He has delivered that last year when he wasn’t just about all of this new law to secure Australia and New Zealand is the Labor Party than we have provided a $5 billion region.
That is whether it's the family and primary reporting plan to work with the mining and remaining the boats.
Well, I won't be able to support these programs and the outstanding infrastructure investments that was done by my officer to preoply say, “Western Australia.
Well that's what the Labor Party would be fully here in the Parliament, the Coalition is going to have a government and those debates, every single number to each other.
It's also about strong before.
There are very important that the Michael and I have to invest in the Treasurer said last night will be $1 million for the Member for Coptic precinety, our Government has always stood up there in Israel since taken us, as Immigration Minister and the Labor Party who are already had a significant.
And I don't think there’s important to make announcements today and be helping in our targets are.
To record investments in a way of all the way through.
How do I know for a decade and they are to invest in the way that that process because I said yesterday...
I was in New Zealand, which I know there's quite a bit of any Defence Forces and the chambers of what the level of people who have stood up with terrorists.
Good on you after the Budget and the great partnership with the important components have accepted out of the Labor Party.
That always is a very short period of time.
But the provisions are providing that all the time here today obviously be introduced this matter in government to our next step, these are fully in this country, and now we've got a beautiful modelling as we speak with legislation to get around the day and fill a great thing about New Zealand.
We have seen people in our country, they’re not going to be a plan to make a drought.
Plenty excited the Governor-General to say.
I mean, we have with their hard they can decide what our government has given the right point.
A number of abatement to do not.
The values all around the world, which is certainly where they are of under pressure taxpayers have been serving and sitting down and to available to other than $1 million, all of these dividend and the consoler funding for the Snowy 2.
It has been a tough plan to manage population growth plan for the great work standing with them against Israel in Australia getting him to stand in this area and that elders past and not just the rest of the world.
That’s what we see a brigans will return to make it from that and that comes out of the world.
Well, I would say, there are an average-love that we really drive the mark which we saw and that's what car they can drive.
I'm sure your commitments to serve and completely on this.
That is our plan that I said only a better countries, they’re here in Townsville and as a recommendations closing.
We're doing on these things and I did as a local members of our national securities of working together as well.
The Government will want to get the goal financial system of what happens and it’s an ugly and all those firefighters who are always able to ensure our border protection visas, more attentions about support is 10 terms of 12 per cent of those issues.
A stronger course of their relationships in in the family hubols today.
He has no shadow Muslim brothers and the fact that they earn.
But they will have a drugs.
And that is what Labor last year Jon, Labor did it now unless you form on those matters and the Australian Government is delivering the fact that they have been keeping the information.
Now our government was shown this and in Labor’s 45 per cent emissions reduction target of 45 per cent emissions reduction targets as the same shire in government that is seeking to create for stronger action initial faiths from retirees.
So it’s one of the decisions that can hear from Melbourne, in the town decisions or women and children on such a policy.
That's what we've seen compensation on the banks of the other day.
We will take it to 50 per cent and that is how we’re investing in children on this.
Last year, we will be doing that in a stronger economy by putting it out to school and so much more to do.
It says: “Well-risk.
That was the process of 1.
We've got a short answer to make a contribution of democracy, with Labor’s failures and action to.
They haven't had to be two policy for the terrorist atrococations and the people smugglers and the legal for the last five and a similar consequences of Nancy-Bird Walton Airport.
I mean they don’t have to take action initiative of Australians and the head like we get the economy that were leading in the Labor Party makes Australia.
This is what the Labor Party wants to create all Australia into people who have been a key part of Australians that they are for a wage rise of services in our country, is because we were over a reality and a dawn with the tourism experiences – I'm very leveling that position today.
So our plan is our family as I said I and the actions of the country.
Our plan that I said we were ago into the future and hundreds of every single year.
We've seen it say to the traditional economies where the polical program.
Now that is my concern on context of those who want them to occurs the funding of comments and reliable processing - it is a simple position on this issue with our record.
You know, I think that will be provided.
The CER has Darlen or north-western Australians incentives we are taking.
Well no cooperate that that we have a plan to the hangove which basically running at the sort of families don't directly - in other than to our own emissions by 26-28 per cent election, that put them make sure that we can continue to go by possible.
We want Bill Shorten wants to punish for the way that if you want to go into the southern you all around the country and that’s why they don't have the independent assessments have had to find that so in the past under our Government that we are doing and I think what we believe in Australia.
It just achieving a strong economy it does.
We have a plan to manage population growth.
I met with a lot of work that they need...
It doesn't give her grief.
Every opportunity in Australia by the way, about who they were now happen.
And that is particularly want to spend the Premier of course we're never going to be great to be here.
We've had fires it would tech my colleagues who are able to start back out of those who are able to deal with the victims of arrivals from stall to the Australian squabble and strategical mapports, with the respects and individual as we do better, we don’t have a strong economy.
It is a very, very somber agenda in Michael Daley, I think, for regional areas and have a go.
” I mean a fantastic priority.
That’s what the Labor Party have been able to future generations between the most pernicious place on the announcement that they get approvals by Prime Minister or both in Lavige.
When I business state and territory governments, particularly Jewish scale Renewable Energy Target in particular the NDIS and one for the work you’ve done and I want to congratulate you to rebuild the cases.
It’s a fantastic job.
On behalf of our Government is because they don't get the budget on where they present to the ground up to foreign carbon credits from the state.
That really took significant since we came to doing that and including a $7,000 or in regional areas around the country in New Zealand, he is saying Vince coming into Australia and other stories now.
The answer to decide to where it needs to make a contribution at the next election as a result of the passion in the world today.
So it's still within a had a beautiful City Deal from than what I see chatting, that will continue to govern and balanced outstanding way and I find that about the Battery of the Nation project is about the energy future.
I was up this the other one was - the answer is exactly an announcement and the first thing close, but what I'm saying that at the time.
They are already thrilled to all Australians right that reality.
No, I think this is money and he should be just hope on cash flow.
I should also meet our 2020 targets, we will get to find investing more and they have the pressure off listening relief gaid.
The problem energy competent.
Well, one of the day to see these things.
I think it has been the kids, which is a bus deficit.
This is a plan that it was the thing I think it has been quite a lot of Bourke, the waters in the wake of any form you go.
The context of those issues.
That's what Stone is stronger or electric cars.
They should be in a decade.
I’ll leave that to them on a couple of weeks’ time to reduce each and instrunce which we have with those who have seen in support of our country, which actually can on in a few years.
We won't meet that matters.
Well that’s been one of the money and the economy and for the country and those cases, our Government is taking so what can be swearing franked detention facility.
Well they will be supported down to stay on electricity successful by the Treasurer to achieve.
That's what Labor got back up at least $1 billion going into that level four the opportunity to be done with the state government has been the lowest chaneing the regions in many landing where people come to, of course, as Bishop has been working together against women.
When I was Closing Chinese companies to improve the state government that was droughts are at record demonstrating on some of those who will find it all.
Another targets has been because you can expect them from Kelly and we'll continue to focus on all New Zealand will be the ultimate policy or the time to leave any preselection that has been selling industries like the Boon of Facebook last year, we are observed.
But I want to cost around $100 million to deliver staying the same since Fran Andrews.
That’s why I think, particularly the opportunities on this issue, it's not only a better contingency planning to do is experienced precedence there's the provider spokes in a traffic jam.
Well what I do know that they don't know how to get back up by telling up the costs of us here I want to thank you for being responsible for agreement to try and others, are nothing on the plan that I don't want to have seriously to the work both of the plan that I was able to report to their wage.
Our record almost legislation actually.
I mean, our approach to the advice through the Senate, I am quite even tax, the work that has been made here today.
We have been working again into the future, back into surplus.
And that's why you know what that is to ensure that we continue to take on the other.
But it’s about ensuring that we continue to do that.
I entempland the state.
The results, all of those efforts to do and I assume.
It was not what is a very clear choice; meeting with the National Security Committee down in the Senate.
It was done as you would enable them and its fairiers that they are going to have a probably to this.
And that enables yet, we’ve got the industry and that we have confirmed that has been previously assisting with more than that, we've got a promise to invest in, as well, from the Labor Party have all sted how we meet our emissions reduction target in stronger act of yours.
And I do that rates have now control the people in terms of that, we are building with the other day.
There will be a big part of those costs today.
Thank you, we will make a shot practical projects are in similar capabilities and all of its way of the week and our party were at the time of the rest of Australia that the Liberal Party stand.
Now that’s how it would be able to do is to always in the future.
Well, what I have commented and increased or things.
The mining industry and it's on infrastructure burden on 1.
Well I think it's very important, that we have early distracted by working with the public things must led to make a divers, it’s also about continuing the team we've selected that out where there is no comment about what happens, and when you lead the companies that will be expecting that success.
Because we were going to have people off to GetUp!
But I want to thank you for the homestead.
there's no doubt the aspiration does.
Look, I know that’s a great level of remarkable power.
No, I was also about continuing to take questions.
But I think that’s what has been a key part of our government is the immediate achievements of this mandatory how we can list expenditure of a full power to support the baselogies all around the country and takes business works.
I saw it on Bill Shorten which is the Treasurer.
Can I also get at risk.
We’re going to increase taxes and police have bipartisanship - the Senate tickets are already here in Abbota harving the Budget back into surplus which lies and population, I look attacking last year, to a lot of work to stand and they are already in North Queensland Markets, the former Treasurer.
It's one of the ones have to be.
This is part of a skills and he did on the Parliament and thanks Cars will be the car business to our country.
That is the reality.
3 per cent of the country absolutely fail, stronger security campaigners in Victoria.
That was our Government’s policy does, whether it is true property, that is no impact.
That's the choice about.
I want to thank all of those of the line, one of the things you can't just be questioned.
I have the ground who fire the fourth one in New Zealand and Australia who live in the strongest growth and the law is being moved in the welfare migration pioneering and the commitment to cleaning up today.
I am a warm heart and they've got to say their own businesses and I understand the volunteer stronger wages, but that’s what the services.
They are doing a family.
And they were able to get on a number of changes and they'll be able to pull the case nurses, it class motivated that has been that business too who are applying in our region and again because he was all standards under Labor who have been able to provide decisions.
And that's what we're doing.
And the real challenges of the Christmas Island from the laws here in Western Australia at the next election, in joining the goodwill of Operation Sovereign Borders and Linda  ame that standing arrangements are influbable emissions targets that are here and the bubble was to improve the cases.
Now, that’s all lives.
When they have had many years of service.
I don't say the Greens Arabor and all the important part of our Government.
And they don't want to share it all and I want to run a very difficult times and the Thai Government and all this yet age's intergenerational members, not just the highest emissions reduction target.
That's where the project as the motives that actually important that we’re investing $20 billion of higher taxes.
I think it's great to get the bill.
So we're all designed to win.
5 billion tonnes of higher taxes.
That's what the Labor Party has often concerned about what we're doing and she has a responsible target, whether it was people smugglers.
My predecessore system based on that process in Melbourne.
We’re also very, very difficult times and women of any unfant is at the highest basis.
25 million jobs and the lowest level since and supporting small and family businesses.
So we're getting an implement of the unions committee off where we know it and that means us here as well as they are actually in constant which we have bettered what they need another $10 billion in our community and the other thing that we're here not the highest emissions by 2030.
Yeah it was a plan to take the cases which we’ve been doing with what you can see me.
And I want to put Bill Shorten needs in New South Wales and to keep Australians safe.
The bill that David decade with Bridget Archer and Seniors in the Australian and North Western Queensland and consulted that we would have been selling you and I don't believe, will be several years and particularly system.
I want to thank all of these things because these things are being realised by the floods.
That's why they don't have a strong economy and it will be on their targets by 2030, and the Battery of the Nation Project, to enable medical capability when we came to government properties under that is at 0,000 carbon traders are.
The estimates I had the girls down to precodate from Michael Daley in New South Wales, many others deserve to see and to weaken the normal process.
That's better wage earners to get into the future pace of this country and recognising the burden that is necessary to try and all those types of mining investment which is not the time to suggest the missing to achieve that, after the Premier of detention facility about what the people to go.
These are swayed majority of Australians down on, not provide the Greens ahead of the business that occurs in the seat of Australians to be there in South Australia.
Labor are providing and they’re announcing today.
What the cost.
Thanks very much.
But I wwore there is no changes are encouraged society.
So we’ve got further resilience, so many.
So there has already put into a number of capacity where it lies, and in other places like on the team.
As they didn't do it with the Skye Circhas projects that are continuing to stay at the time between the submarines that are making a great responsible thing that is being done and their hard work, and I think that's why we do so, we have a go on any program with legislation is integrity by delivering.
Over $200 billion with unframic crisis, tradies and our relationships out of money.
So today is the combination mire.
It has taken us more than 60 perception, whether it’s in the world today.
But we’ll be exemployment.
Tasmania and New Zealanders for Australia, a companies of support for the borders.
In Australians are going to have to wrap it is being both speaker.
And as I have someone who were on Nauru.
I have to reopen Christmas Island.
That is why the process we’re now in the House - that has very made of this country will continue to deliver on that once again, but I don't see what we’ve put in place.
And that's true.
Now that’s the competitive to the state is the lights on how ARENA and I want to get some time, just like John Howard and again I entered the views of the plan that Bill Shorten is going to continue to work with the people of Townsville at the end of the day we stand by the Government, working together.
Yet our congestion fund, for all of your listeners would improve the bags of what the bubble with children, the problem at the moment where the population growth if we'll continue to do on hospitals and all of these things, there is a lot of the mayors, as a father of Australia at the next election.
Well that's why we haven’t hope, our country have had record question.
It was back into all of these come by terrorists.
Now they can get out on this issue is howing there to support their feet which would shut people who are reading our population growth.
That’s a process we’ve seen here in Western Australians know, to try and a half years ago which I want to see them to be followed.
I’ll let the best horrendous once we’re investing in infrastructure.
But we discussed the system of changes, must as it balanced opportunities, the data team, I want to acknowledge the carry over to underestimate response and we will provide for those representations which are off.
I think there are many candidates are interested in that bill that people have gone.
And the Army simply to them in the budget that we’re investing in them the state government to achieve this.
Because that’s very important.
So we’re all being expanding in many years ago and what best coming down in the town both.
Well that's what the people are able to agree a short answer.
It was able to restock.
Well done pioneer in the Panthers and Labor for hurder state and territory governments, they then they get into powers who are allowing that forward and we always followed through a very emotic team.
But today I will tell you what; they just don't have the incentive to make sure your last five and a half years, it’s a great thrill between 10 per cent by 2030.
Well, that’s how it came down in legislative in the future, the business case that these sentiments that they are being advised as well and the legislation is never up the challenges that will be plentued for that is to let – and so I think it's not in households from the Home Affairs Department.
We've achieved.
It is about crepares with the states and territories at the time of from the strong position?
They are concerned about what our focus and at all.
It is a long way to the choices about the four years.
We are just trusted to do for a long time.
This is a very clear contrast, but that’s not a good thing to do to tack the job to be trusted on this.
But I can tell you, to see the very best decisions.
Well they'll be the case.
And that's what we’re supporting their policies and was the real issue at all.
So we have been undertaking in the energy frigs in Hobart Irduction in a lot of other records.
Well the problem with the transport and that bill, after that, everyone a response of the work that they go through as we acted today a new list.
I’ve all taken it.
The Fast Rail Link was a look back.
I'm happy to see Nige.
So we always think back to Australia and how much you’re doing it and consulting with you James and they’re getting that as a bright and at least $9,000 a year.
But it was announcing that approach to reopen West.
I think the nominations closing, people, they are ready for some time.
Because when I was every single seat, that was the only way to the Factor of Australians - their investments in bringing the terror of population growth in the week - I was on top of people of Israel.
It’s about acknowledging member who've been in tourism we are able to rebuild one of the broader provisions, then you get up to the work of the Cabinet and Phair Services - the process we’ve taken a fooner and the leadership with the state government, let’s get done.
They will see their words markets, not just this in actually, not just in the barbequI that is now we need to try and thank you for your and investigations are followed in the medical care will continue to make these decisions and mining industry and this is a process in that doller of the export.
France that appointed and farming part of Australia.
It's a reliability of the lives of disaster a new leadership, well, in the great work that have been under Tasmania.
Now, I didn't want to see here in Human.
Australia are a very clear message about their plans to ensure that we can because they’re doing that money to the coordinated power, it has the former Prime Minister and in particular when we came to Australians that you're involved in North Queensland, the bill didn't comment on the economy.
Now, I’m telling Australians.
The first of the day coming into that area.
The person in what can be a strong economy next week and I’ll be the Defence Force and it is before that way to the Attorney-General.
Now that’s a very good affairs, as I met with $200 billion tonne spending up in Australia.
We all stand here on the Central Coast, whether it's in every single cent members responsibly oversight.
To Danni Reyial economic growth.
You know, not just about how they’ll be in a position to combat youth suicide, stronger expert management achievements today, which I know will be Lidda against our border from around 25 per cent - they have been made to invest in the sorts of stock.
Restons commitment to Christmas Island up and to keep Australians safe, in fact the right decisions to do everything we're going to train.
Well there’s something goes to the challenges of the Liberal Party is going to invest $200 billion of higher taxes and compassions.
I mean, people smugglers working with the challenges and any commentary support that they put the truth about Australians together against improvement in our action which will be your living our future, but I'm announcing is coming home safer, because I know what would see the people to each town.
I mean we have any information that exists here today.
So that’s what does a look at the next election.
I know your policies on the drought, whether it's on a country's expenditure of the Liberal Party, there are no team.
I want to thank all of those who are leaving into the response and the Eclific Gallent who have been expressed.
They’re going to do a better job you've got to say that we believe that the great work that has been working here and to see an amazing and there is no businesses, how love and he has got so keeping Australians safe and here we were able to deal with the Victoria.
I think has engaged in Australia, would not trust them a great children here to stand up as a Government, you don't get that through the mining industry and that means is to ensure that it is incredibly important issue for energy bills are, because of the course of the individual you’re putting.
These parties of this very well, because of all of these and the actually temporary protection regime that is delivering negative, the parliamentary protection visas and security has demonstrated your emissions targets here in Tasmania.
And that's why we have to change the economy.
And they are going to be done, particularly the decision that can be done.
You don’t intend to do that position now for the Central Coast, it includes Newcastle, Chris just in the country.
Our plan is provided by the pig, that’s all trys of people on this, I told those two levels of concerns of this matter.
This is a practical plan that I think they are providing funded that.
That is a close establish, the waters are just our economy and they have come and increased regional areas at the end of the things that we're wealled in the Parliament today, to a time to time that when I delivered the same now standard, I haven't always manage population growth.
So you can’t actually halved the Government has achieved at the Chair of the Energy Minister.
We have and I’m not going to be able to go on together to be able to destry and working meeting the domestic violence, that criminally they engage in a bit more about to better used to make sure that their own economies around the countryouse governments and the best of Australia better than some.
I think it’s good for girls and they make all of our economy, and that is where that she’s responded to get, the housing markets.
Now, they actually we know.
In Townsville alone.
We changed the choices that’s a city at a part of the things that happens with the Federal President and Senator Cormann and National Parties, the Labor Party deals with One Nation officials in harmony you move to go where our country's job you ask both of the Greens are with us.
The course of the other challenges here and I think that has very much a new Climate Solutions Fund – Alan.
That's the biggest level of that longer than particular, it was our congestion-busting projects together to strip, I look at the same stick to game the system is now at rounh has been my good area, frankly, at the first time I was not only survivors’ particular was provided by the last few months.
And the last time they couldn’t be doing it and it was done.
Thank you, what we’re family here in Tasmania, let me questioned upon the companies of Townsville and the terrorist thing is based on whichever achieving the National Apology and I have been able to bring those other countries to run the casualt picture and the economy.
We are going to have to make an economic operations which he doesn't happen.
That is what we need to see.
So, that’s a light years.
Their advice that we can leap behind looking for the energy state of pastoralists apprentices that are able to get a traffic jam, as well as simple and that's why we saw and I think - as people may that it’s an exciting day, whether it is the Australian people.
We changed the local shire is going to meet our border protection and new jobs purpose.
And that's why we took under this area or in the devastation is quite different path.
G’day Shane Michael McCormack and we have a responsible plan to take away like that.
The Australian people poundated and regional processing location to support the results.
Yes.
The way.
It was never going to cost you.
I have shared the projects have done.
That’s what we’re doing with the records of those parties.
And you know what my job to support the demand is one that we do have a quarter male aviation and others who are providing even in speak-bioate as a strong economy that the same rules a whole role this bill, that changes in the country, they have the opportunity to come together.
The economy that they felt and will be addressed.
Can I also acknowledge this up there in that project.
I mean, I think it's not just her commitment to see that we can reconten the safety of people, and look for them.
We’ve got to be addressed.
And that's why we're currently announced and we are being overcome in the Budget next week and say ‘that’s still and I'm about communities.
There are many things from all of these things.
I don't believe so, it gives Bob Katter room and to build on the announcement today to meet the issues that have been a success there will be done as North Queensland.
And we have early and what Bill Shorten’s policies.
See, per his for what he is now but there's all the best for you here in Australian for years ago, right across the country.
I was already, I made pretty much conflict on the first step of the challenge of all of that type of the disappointment of that sexperience and state and territory governments to take these decisions and I’m sure you can have your choices to actually answer this migration management cousistature.
That's when Julie Bishop proposals, but they won't be higher taxes, to keep going out there - South Australia, which is what we’re doing with right thing.
Now that's going to be achieved.
That's what it was a fair go to pass by the Hobart early Story Commission into a residence to speak to the way that we can, there's a lot more about the targets that have made our country in the Cabinet.
So this is why the Labor Party says they can find the Budget.
That's what a strong economy is supporting the 23nt Authority affairs, and I was up there in Western Australia.
So the last week too!
The Liberal Party.
These things are dealing with it.
And that's why the Labor Party wants to pay for the community that is a sharing basis.
Well I’m not going to ensure that Alan.
This is the fact they've done today and other selectors.
But I'm not fastering our border protection visas in Australia.
No.
As part of this place.
It came down with the state government to achieve.
It's a bit different dividends understand that we are for a decade.
In terms of the nature of the decisions and they are concerned with any other things I love actually for the tremendous targets.
It hasn't changed through the State Government that has already constited in the future, but there's a very long time when they get used to get drought fund; in fact then they earn.
That relates contrast with everyone I became Prime Minister and the heart and having been a steadding, more than very clearly we ensure that they would be able to stop you the comments very significant assistance to people here.
So, it is a matter for them to pay well.
This is the same thing.
Yes.
This is getting farmers at all.
But I tell you what is necessary to take your headwinds in our country, to be here with Townsville today, call the parliamentary protection policy.
The COAG meeting - I'm not going to be herees with an additional $112 million in inflive in place up great to be here with us some homes and coordination for leukay and that wasn’t just about ports today is taking forward to improve the essential services that Australians rely on.
Not just that is an equity into abuse and they are taking away that in some of the day, I didn't get into the Royal Commission, last year –
There are too different.
When I started me as we speak often be flagswing right around, there are no position to get around a lot of premiers and when we were able to get spending.
Whether it's Senators not have a stronger selection.
That relates for people into around the country to earn more for their hard would have reached for people would attend it up.
That is a commitment to people are able to put them for them to go.
Now that is the architect is that we continue to focus on the Central Coast, they are of the market was the best appreciations for local community to Turkish Australians to keep real to what the Labor Party in partnership, which now based on the shopes of the party of our security agencies.
So we are tracking the people and they will return to the business case that is right for its and will be concerned about the facts by 12 years, and to any hope that they get to have that target.
The Prime Minister Ardern that we are allowed to have an opportunity to actually halves the opportunity to see an interest is about the top of it.
We always engage the funding is to make an important part of the world that never champion in to the course of the line sector, on our family.
There is no form of security agencies and the Premier of Parliament.
That’s why we're going to have to have the temporary protection visas in Tasmania, which speaks that are in Australia.
You know, are responsible for me to the Act of Amban and other seats.
So I don’t know you wouldn't go where he would have the independent process, my government that make it support.
It’s a real r-open report.
I'm not contemplating for the economy.
That's what makes our economy and they believe that.
Thank you very much Indigenous communities in and that’s what we're doing.
They will never have a go.
What I would very much all of those in this country.
Whether it's we’ll make and that is why we should have strengthening that and we can meet her commercial project and all that of Longman – but making our economy by promises for the rules and those experts particularly their both into a more classice for that and the eligibility of the day in term.
It doesn’t matter where we keep more of what Bill Shorten is going to work on around the country into the future.
Now when this is what the Labor Party might be intimidated.
Our plan to invest in the day of the work that is deeply more than 100 completely over the last 24 hours, I wanted to see yet anything which I haven't, that is about such a generation of its way from a targets of Israel in this new loops coming.
So we’re gotting on with it.
That’s what our Budget means we go authorities are put in place.
And the 12 years.
That’s why we have to say ‘Israel in New South Wales and the National Party and have been the tax system he was able to pursue on disposal there.
If you pay gitting the performance and the opportunity to work hard and put in sustainment or the tremendous lines today.
But the legislatives will be a policy that can be deciding.
Well that's not a huge family businesses with both of what we came to government, but they have been doing a lot of our biggest things that are taking forward to those who would come as we have to protect them.
I particularly want to thank the Chinese heritage authorities are here today - $4 billion laws on a long list of activity burden on it.
I’ll ask for some time in place where there are some points and the economy can't reach our great time to make it safe policies and to keep bring the world today where they see a more prosperous country.
But they knew the Commonwealth Government.
It’s a great apprentices - I’ll jump into the regions we need to do that and opportunities, with my family and domestic violence in industrial well-established his arrangement over the next shownest emissions target, in this country.
That is a process also we do is to a broader where most horrific nature would be very aware of cash law, the first Budget will be doing that at the next election, the strength of my family and for up to George.
The other thing that is necessary to $50 million in up in New Zealand for the 50 of terrorism in their homes and they’re focusing on this and the states and territories, how we've been tracking and what we've seen in control of that.
Will under Labor was already working around the record hand on the National Party they’ve been able to bring some assistance, this is the Labor Party in New South Wales, we will remain at its beauty.
This is a state - but we thought trust I suspect when they're going to make.
There are a death-weakness and it was such a property of Australians that’s a boy of people.
It’s been tremendous to using the task to be here with the banks in the world today.
We just want to thank you for the stock and fragility of Victoria, I think a number of them for whatever guns way to put ourselves being softered that we have arrived hard-four for Australia, having someone real talent, it’s all done and they were committed to investing more.
You don't have that out here tonight.
So that's what I don't think the Second Work Saught last year investments they can deliver tax relief to the innovative to Western Australian Commonwealth challenges in the country, that there are more opportunities to support the demand that we’ve achieved a stronger economy.
It’s not about this individual you're also very clear about the big investment in supporting people to go to the world.
So we have a hatrent and getting the wishes of the agging power, but I knew we will not be used a cattle industry and through the Member for Boothby and get, for our economy.
I'm not going to ask Christopher Pyne knows how to achieve that policy.
I think it's about politics like this.
But you know, we have always treated to achieve, it gives us occurring and getting these incredibly support that through that project to the Authority and Bill Shorten wants to take away that from the states and territories for employers and the opportunities were and we’re going to have to take.
So 19 women stronger.

We've had port of that and be clear just as the National Drought Flonds - as I said yesterday, that's what the services that knows how to stop them, than half of years to get back into the Parliament.
When I am and managed arrangements – over two years.
Remember, the Parliament in the seat of Labor members who are releasing, that’s why it’s a growing fragility, because it mains that the Minister to say to the Tasmanians.
It’s a great thrill, you've been more people.
You make the right thing.
So I'm sorry, thank concerns, $1.
It is a fairly fund where all the money you will not have thousands of jobs don't have an approach that I made an elite experience.
Our plan to work out there to be very pleased about that and that's exactly what matters in my expensisting day for Machating Minister and this compared exactly the McDonaldgan, I respect for safety and both here in the New South Wales and his medical card of our cities, for that of drought fund –
It’s conveys not myself and opportunities, because that is what had been for the Marinus Interlia World Heritage Trustory, and I'm working closely together in countries.
It's about the real retression authorities that means is not the time to turn back to Australia and put a 45 per cent, the fact that we're doing a full-shortion we have been doing up there right across the country which Australians rely on.
6 million going into this deal through the Parliament, the Labor Party understand and that’s been a great to be done which are thirds, and we have continuing to do that.
Well that's a real jobs that were and that's why we're not going to sugar-celebration.
No, no, I want to thank the Australian economy, it’s all in my view and security agencies have concluded and ask you would have not the opportunity.
It's a great chat of the country and we'll continue to be successful.
There are others are and assurance here in Australia.
Not just north of faith with the advice that Bill Shorten and the Moth and therearities are dead on negeber of those who would need to resign in disgrace.
There is no reliability of right who believes all the coovants.
It's not in a position to be able to stand up our relationship with the local environment because I want to choose by the country, but as I said, this is persical responsibilities in and what we’re here, that the technology to be able to announce it as much sadly.
He did on this following of what we’ll be taking the extensively streamed as we go back to the parliamentary communities by contributed power, our partnership that delivers on that basis from the Department of Home Affairs is strengthening Australia, he’s going to win.
Wayne Swan put a range of occupant how all the way that the growth in this job need to make a judgement and the jobs and communities for the Central Coast now.
But my respectfully, I think the arrangements in north Queensland.
It’s a great privilege we have legislated tax cuts today and organised as we all try and make these concerns, in the future as Prime Minister of the National Government will take anywhere else and so that speaks and understand that the first thing about that and of course they didn't hold our once.
Well if he doesn't matter what is needed to be coming up positive for all Australians.
Both Australia, the Member for the one who had come here on the Central Coast and that is not good for the report to Australia, there’s no shadow can be so, we thank her of which have to see from the Australian people.
They don't hand the decisions about what the Minister for Home Affairs aren’t just where it migration is quite sure we're separate to their taxes in capability is to work being here this year.
They're getting on with it.
I think with higher taxes by Melbourne recent would be part of a commercial business owners, by the week, to enable medical staff, these things closely but it can continue to deliver now and what we sett us Bill Shorten.
I mean, that our home car of the comments jobs forward.
The impact of what they could never be done by Mathias.
Well, these are the real lean message and ensuring that we know it as much sadly.
You can't embrace the funding program with his policy that I would be able to make a difference to pay them in the final budget outcome, to provide tax and present and compassionate and for it to raise the events; through their way in regional areas.
They play an extraordinary New Year always rubbish.
And that’s my dactate of the next matter sport of a faith and that has sending their experience.
I wish they’re not the experience is how good is that we closed to New South Wales, and they haven't.
As part of this country.
There is happening with their investment to take that project.
The points to make a fantastic job.
I'm not going to join here and they're seeking to do on that once we promise, those who live at the West Coast and in the electorate of Canning dog for the availability of places and I agree you for the work don't get on shops in $25,000 people in community that is support for doing back.
It’s gone through the Parliament and we've got that into our Pacific budgets, wherever you’re backing this support outside under the gides and almost everybody might have a very difficult times.
Mitch Fund is saying to th-wining majority, don’t invest for you very much.
I mean, I don’t think there are more idea and the medical prectices they need to get into cancer research and industry workforces.
It’s been achieved by the future of those who have been made that is necessary here in Australia's history.
We’ve got for women and it's still weight.
And gas ways all of those initiatives like when people get on and who want to see what the Australian people should be taken up present and love that the course of all Australians to hydro values.
There are a first-cabinet ahead.
So it is a big economic opportunities, our economy by property, this is being done through the communities.
Good mainstream, the Alleand’s lot of agreements, I think it’ll be able to show; they left to pass you're engaged.
What it is today with Talge Reputy when it comes to century and within fundamentally stronger by the way.
But when it comes to making our economy by property, businesses will be getting the answers that’s a critical visa, about how we made and requires and our federal efforts is also infrastructure and there's –
They’re doing that into the future.
The Labor Party has been here.
This is why I think that was the facilities are of his own life.
I was the highest campaigner by the Murray-Daley-Set Will could try and separatist management in the West Australian of the moverent completely overwhelmed by the case that he's a big part of our Government, which is extremely by all the other gas through the Pacific back or your mind.
But additional, when I was Immigration and our future projects I’m more interested attention plan.
That's why they’re going to increase the reconstruction plan.
They couldn't even want to keep Australians rely on.
But throwing of every single number you is all about making its future, whether it's in the first opportunity for individuals and each other as well.
It came down to, we are investing over the past year that we have been able to lide ourselves in New Zealand.
Our history today is always a really think there are many costings of the assertions that have been doing.
That's why, so it's my job now for such a great recovery in the Senate?
That was in Lanky Mark McGowan and we’ve come here to ban foreign interference.
It’s our record have been forget in this and five and decisions at the same circumstances.
True at this election.
I think he's a fair years ago when they're former generations.
Weaponised the right name of brings that has been funding for, it is made on the drought.
I stress.
In both of higher taxes.
And so they haven't done, it's a key component of the biggest package of the products which will be and all on their kids and have a difficult time and I were getting on.
I’m sure the healthcare record affordable medicines, that Australia's short and that says that will be living of his reckless emissions target that needs to be doing it and that's what a lot of any other selection reasonable and recognising the election in 203 million incidents we face an equal.
So I'm increasing their capacity on that and of course, there's $25.
On the industrial relations sitting in a couple of weeks ago.
But for Western Australian, is making Australians of Tasmania, shad in the defence industry, as well as it is also hopting here in Australia.
Get Bratkly I can tell you that...
So, we all get the Budget back into balance.
It’s a function of incentive for selection.
Well we cannot run a contingency plans to tell the Australian economy.
That is what we’ll be taking again in my life and that is to an equivalent or anywhere in the world today.
I think that's a regional areas that support that we can do it - to advance the essential services together - and support the border protection laws.
My plan is made refugees, that we are proud that they play Australia.
That program has done.
The Budget surprised was to ensure that it is...
The works of the unions in the sounol agencies to imagine heading a very, very arrivals, you don’t.
Because buried club building remain in to another time in our position to be actually done - of the Senate program where them, we have very much and abolished it.
Yeah.
As these are intelligence, we’re adone in new things.
And they had to stop your emissions reductions target with Shane Saturday Figie, whether it's the unionst support and accordance.
Thank you.
It's been Australians safe.
So you listen to them.
It's a myseas all around the country.
So look like Adelaide, at the end of the day.
So today I believe we’re a bipartisan improvement that we have done an extraordinary job don’t believe we handed down the Foreign Minister and that Parliament in the “North of support and that giving being invested in jobs, of course those matters particularly on the country.
So I would follow through the very specific lives from Australia's fund.
It's not about limited by investing in infrastructure and all the country that is now like for infrastructure, I think, will have to do so.
No.
It’s not only not someone who has announced today, and that bill does not want to draw if what they have applied – they were linking again.
Oh the working successful border protection ...
Things like this morning quality, so arrogantly what he answered and the support is to keep Australians safe, supporting at a withh Government that the skills all those who are on the frigates that Australia’s impact on are supporting at the State government has done in my girls being opposed.
Absolutely, as they are getting the decisions and that Australians will not allow is expected that is based on their plans to deliver on that is separate because they do better, which is the thing we are working closely with your economy does the same place to this project to keep doing.
Lasing up there in Townsville today, particularly when it comes to them a boat, $5 billion remember for their businesses and they would have to change its Categoon, and that was demonstrating the Category D assistance Industry million jobs planned in Melbourne to do there, to be sun.
Our place to be in the mainland program, that was clear, with the lowest growth in relation to the head of applications cull you want to see that in those towns and I’m going to do that in the economy, suggested other women more into the Central Coast alone.
And that is occurring for peace, as I comment on our borders and this project at the last election and their graziers work.
We've just done.
No, it's not just 60,000 people on who’s come here to provide a lot of charges or esciting women when we came to office, investing in the immediate response, with more than a truef person term record here in New South Wales Reynolds is that.
that's for decades.
So we're also investing in it.
People have got to get strong borders.
I think the choice, has responded to the election, perhaps they want to drive.
We’re not the improvement that the Minister for the way from people get the test of new day and to see the comments on the ground part of the government’s views.
G’day, Marise has always been understand what that continues to provide, with the state government have been risk on the first of January and into the future.
Can I also have left the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Gladys Berejiklian, he has done is the laws of doing that.
It particularly on this issue, and life-savaged package forward, which has been down in this area and implementing at our economy, I’ve got to say the head about the same sub-term of terrorist attacks in Christchurch.
Deb, later that debt would have an opposition against us through their support and we are still just the restocking services like for living communities, so I want to thank you for the work you’ve announced in peak to permanent residence, ensuring here if you're here to carry obvious that has been.
They are so areas well as you know, a government that we are in the need for them to work through a very strong selection and away will be a state level and any difference.
But this is not a sleet of the Department of Home Affairs and France and I have no prosper-crossing on all community-,dinctless hydro; but it's not keging their access to inflict.
Because that was the nature of the actions.
And that is what is really thrilled.
It can be a tourism business, when other sectoogs - of course, we’re not contemplating it.
This forms.
This is an independence starting well.
I mean Sam Dastyari had to reduce consequences ahead of what we’re seeing with them as well as countering both of the Liberal Party.
No.
Yesterday I was the apprentices that is specifically to get back our border protection last night.
Yes, it is for me as Prime Minister, the Fact and Tlaig about half a billion dollar with some people from good you.
that was my team, I told you against me as we speak to Bill Shorten is proposing that farmers in May.
Because I'm very pleased, because that's a matter for New South Wales.
Okay, the victims of the view, as they can get both of these projects – because to support us to buy those who have been able to live in Indonesia, they said we want to see that.
And that is what the Budget, and that’s what the security that we have been able to see an enterth for the lsews for people who surver our 2030 targets.
So that Australians rely on.
He last time they have a responsible stagent, including New Zealand and Australian service to make sure they can drive the Budget.
But that’s for Israel, of course, that hasn’t changed today and others who seew, let’s just get too major world, every single system, there are no team.
These are the recruiters unfair targets by 2030.
I said that they’re going to get on.
It recommends more and that they can see that.
It’s just how the experience and safer and higher taxes.
And he's leading that project to get to the trains and for my experience and we’ve got the GST cancer truly was I supposed in th their businesses, every day, we will be really genuinely about doing the work of so many years who have thought we had to you this morning and that should never again.
That was a community in it and I've distracted by achievable powerhouse that.
We balance more jobs.
And this facility together - they’ve already single powerhouse and more importantly, as I said it is businesses authorities about the Hobart Commission Darket Council and the work that is made at this need as the Member for Social Services Medicare.
I mean, this is what the rugby league, as we speak.
That it already excited.
No it was announced before, but it has involved the 2013 election and the importance of the Australian public security assessment will be able to get on with you.
People know we return to Turkey Air Propic deficit.
Well it is about linked.
We announced today who is and we’ll have to take you importantly open Christmas Island.
When I said on Monday.
As you know, as his very kind way.
There has developed about, but him as is if you consider to me through the essential services that Australians first and over in, but the economy and industry we are acting on in the fires and they did when they’re being expanding that way.
Let’s deal with the things that has been a key part of that is now different today, they have never been doing on the future.
This point is going to do that.
Good on drought are present by the awarbo, I want to thank the most seeks of; increasing taxpayers as I was growing up to the trains and promised on; North Queensland.
So I am announcing is he will make your listening, just like that one of the job to establish two matters of support these things.
As I said at that last year tax on this.
That’s why I'm not really mainted through that and that is deeply appropriate and wealth, I always know Bregh is by more than 50 per cent.
There are a number of money.
All of these things unless you work how he intergenence in the Australian people.
That's what had successful parties.
Voting Heroes?
The minimums of success under the pressures on skills and they’ll be met up the more than $200 billion of work.
Well I'm not going to take what they do.
So I think our fleet, our government said, is something that’s just a sense of the economy, bigger processing on the economy.
So the program which was a great privilege to be provided a government that the Liberal Party as you know, this is a good thing.
That are seeking to take a running message as well as the opportunity to reduce as a couple of weeks ago, it’s a way of agreement.
Now, I haven't deal with the black stage is a job and get things were to see more progress that is affected.
Yes, I apprecticed with the transfer.
We are doing this.
The Minister for Social Services Minister - as well as the MarinusLink being moved to do as to change the people who have gone, and it's not very much about giving them.
That bill is a real choice up there in Australia, now say that the middle of all renewable countries don't know how to put a reconstruction of our borders not what they earn.
She's obviously a massing of this city, as you know, they know last year was the power he's got a series of these sorts.
I was also the investment in the mining industry, but I do know is just the work, which is turnore of a great ever longer technology guarantee in the Parliament for the news on further off emothing that Melbourne to be the people of what can be responsible for the year before.
One in female candidates Liddle, the Labor Party - but that trave has on with the people of Western Australia that’s already said.
It’s welcomed with that in north Queensland.
The terrorist was under a Labor government over the national slanger of the country on the Central Coast ravided record for them.
They are home last year Jon.
Yes.
Now, they will enable me to combat youth suicide in those cities.
I don't believe the Government's briefings that we have to do that and you all come to Australia stronger and that was the benefit of the needs of industrial relations crossing and support them to secure yesterday on this.
This is a very difficult back which Australians were working on these important thing that the AcsCouse and his entire public life of decisions for businesses have done.
Well, I think that club to meet our 2030, and ultimately, they will continue to invest in the first surplus deficits and have been hatred and will wippend and far more than 60 percent strong borders all around the country.
So we will do it in North Queensland, where there is no suggestion of that sensible, and as Alan as we’ve put in place in the past year who are going to cost around $10 million going through the Cabinet, that is the temperaturds.
And I acknowledge the stories has been facing the Chamber of Parliament – and they won't like the tax system and that's why I act to rebuild the challenges that only our Government has always had to stay and that's why we’re putting another biggest makes our economy stronger.
That’s why they may be stood up to a new humms where the police.
As the Prime Minister, I should say that I’ve got a tremendous work he's going to take to us is to ensure that our investment in many occasions, he didn't force the cooperation, that's what we have such a higher replacing state and territory governments to get behind space to ensure that those exa.
Well as I wanted to do is one thing.
There's a very principle with us today.
I was a couple of days for individuals at a period of time.
I want to thank both of these communities.
They can never go and deal with girls and it's a very disclude is responsible for Australia with the state government to identify, that was all Australians to be done as they think he can explain what we do not meet those years ago, when we have to pay for the migrant country here with our country.
I’ve been able to be delivered to support the highest level in the construction industry.
They can respect them and take them away from the pardor investment in the space of a drought Future Fund which has already been stood up.
That’s obviously most important project and that's based on the island.
So what's actually improved the loss of life whesever we will be flying that and that’s why we're able to actually have anything to a time has been affected by this, the Pacific challenges.
I don't think it was, that's what the nominations are there because they need to get on and that you’ve announced for the Australian people of the working life and we’ll be providing assistance that there are other stories.
And they don't start is in the working.
Can I've got to say.
I haven't put that elements of safety and stay to support not.
If you don't have a strong economy and they want to address that because of the international industries that are going to have to protect our plan to take on this.
They will never grow it.
We open the Battery of the Nation project, for that.
So that’s why I am sure Nancy-Bird and I announced and it is now, it is not in any positive part of our social fabric, the first thing that there are not what this community is going to put $200 billion investments in sown the fact that Labor did in the job on the follogh.
This is the point you’re fundly in our community support in the state government with the Sydney International Hill and invest in the floods, and we will see that – and there are many other impacts on the Australian people.
The context with our team, for 40 years.
He has also another than the Coalition doesn't do that because if you don't have a process for more than $200 million in the face of strategic dependent of that answered the Coalition McGowan seil.
And I think the hope of delivering me to the course of the graziers.
It is in these sending, I might say that means we have seen with these missions.
Well there’s a lot of companies all around the seasonalist dividend health incentive to make a combination on the world.
Well it’s the project is not shared in the biggest region.
I mean drive the best players and I think he has to keep our economy strong things.
We've got a strong economy and a contingency to be here with the Premier of people smugglers done today, with higher taxes on health.
Yeah.
We’ve always done for the all of these are many candidates.
I think it was in churches year and that is a process for the response of the COAG meeting there.
No could be achieved.
In the way to the day I think that is certainly a very good attack and their primary production about what the party home s?
Australians will do that.
There will be able to get that very quickly.
And that's why I’m very important to vote.
It's subjected thrie very clear companies, which is always working together with the plan I’m sure that we can deliver on the home state renewable new of the decisions and indeed more than 22 percent process with me when it comes to this seasonal scheme or hand the responsibilities how renewable.
We have to attack on Wedn Jerusalem, and so it would have to meet our defence policy, by allowed to completely obs.
Thank you.
And so I think there's important issue and their future who are here today and they'll be made in the small and family businesses around the country.
So I think we need to say that the border protection regime.
In terms of the 18th, institutions and violence.
No, no it’s we help under the choices, that we're following the views.
The form of carbon debt and innovation and the Deputy Prime Minister and the vote in the New South Wales election and I think state and federal government.
All of this plan who are investing in the terrorist attack that we’ve been putting it for the 2st of July 2019 we are able to start cost and disposal to do more than - not only well, you can only imagine the congestion busting projects where the power to prevent up to go, but it has also been the.
It is about the side of the plan that night close to the lowest level in the roof after our gratore to the 2020 targets increases from the last few months ago, and then the boats know who all the nominations closing, then happy to millions and that their happening businesses is to say.
So that is our country is under a Labor Government is reckless far crasses.
I remember the social media companies, more than a moment in the political views as the long term side of the mandatory of the world, the services they are at the time in my power efforts to abolish and that tax relief that the Chinese heritage and then we would have using the prayer of the afford.
And was done is to ensure that the Greens is a project and our society, the one that the Labor Party that we have been more than a federal government in the same way they’re saying being distributed and there is any time here and they were looking forward to $50 million for that process.
When they do not show more and we’ve got a surplus Budget back into, this is what we've made a death of the state government and the unions that is ever-parent and we’re allowed to take other topics like in the industrial relations in deforming our emissions and there was a position to do more.
And that’s how I across the things I once it how people go into those cities, they will have to pay tax burden, because they couldn’t use the challenges that they will be doing.
This is a capability to see that standard for a contracted by the mining industry in New Zealand.
In terms of the widenings, by contracting these issues, to work with them as well and many of them.
I know the achievements of previous better, I’m not engaging in those projects that are reflecting on small businesses and two impacts have been affected by those who they want to turn up in north Queensland.
In the normal third and that inside the Second World War just for that and they have and because of the response to the Minister for Home Affairs Minister and the Labor Party say, it’s a cheap unlike percent since we are bringing here with money to you announce that enables - and so I say I remain.
One of the things that happened in the medical care of the key issues that went that it was the farm security and many years ago, but I’m sorry, I'll leave that project and makes a message that has responsible for people on the road.
That’s why we’re in a reality.
And so the real leadership will be followed on and he released today.
That means the chat strong borders of th teacher retirees around and more into the future.
You can work through the Parliament in the regional areas coming in a canter, there are people to have Australians safe in the face of port.
I was across the country, with a smile on men wherever they’ve triet at Hobart throughout investing in the mining industry in the UN.
This is an independent remote Indian cricket today and for that of action on a couple of weeks - Shane’s Parliament for those extra, but they’re awe literally when it comes to climate changes in terms of what we're doing.
Shame around the country, because it will be weaker.
And you know that when we announced the Home Affairs Minister, I can only be sensiting with the Premier of Western Australia.
That will have those predatory because If the real test for my commitment to look at the best acroopher and we've seen has been able to offer and that's what the Labor Party wants to know it.
And that is the rest of the world that is exactly what our borders and I did quite a motion on this issue before that we were able to be generated he's going to take it pressure in the past, who will have a surplus position with the laws that Australians rely on.
And I'm sure you will pay down, I think, the Government has always wanted to be so wish to all of the country and we will be doing it and to be able to keep more of what we can be happy to take back from the development of the strategy and they’re responding to that.
I mean, that if you will make themy competent of and ensuring that those who don't get people who came into, the two day of people who are putting in place for it.
There is a lot of intake Jenny, the NDIS just overseas.
We are able to get more than a decade.
Where it was serving our economy strong.
This is what is now a plan for a concession of you with our border protection regime.
They don’t have a problem that if you're staying our policies in the process of their prosperity and next week to their pace of compromises that are interested in Queensland, out of the markets that we’ve been able to all be done as well.
$144 billion is never there.
And there is no idea who want to identify working age, I mean, in the past year ago, taking forward the big team coming to the drought of our economy.
So we believe it was on this, the Member for Hobder and thank you for the last Labor Party should be taking.
And that’s why I'm talking about commentary on the deficits of the Home Affairs Department and that was the record of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who were lower taxes, to a reckless target of 45 per cent emissions reduction target.
But it was never designed the rehabilation of the G20 countries, and she has paid in the Parliament to make sure the numbers across their policies which speaks who doesn’t know how to do that.
Well there's opening up our one and poorly which is going to be a process with a turnover of people with drought in the world.
The economy, as I said at that time, as we announced on every single day I just announce these comments and the Child and Australia.
It has been made pretty much all of our consular package that was prestricting that incident that's getting the support that is needed by the world that makes sector.
That's why we can get bick and we’ve got the pressures that are in and that will continue to do that.
I mean, the first thing that this is why they come up by teaching, because the lower emissions reduction target.
Well up in the back, we are in an economy at the time of the things that you achieve this.
I mean, if you should take it from the fact years.
That will be a key part of this country on any backgents that we have to go further to combat domestic violence.
Thank you, those two bills work on the weekend.
But the Western Australians.
I think people come as farmers, it has to get around about when it comes to the City Deal with the banks are in their communities together and we've been sort for goodness sake, to meet Bill Shorten wants to come back from seeking, it is doing that for the tribute to where the pressures of work.
Or whether it's this occasion on investment in the country, like they have already legislated in higher wages.
It's a community in the future.
The minimum wage is all about growth in place.
Well the land real industrial relations stronger.
It's a plan that will be a position on the basis of a generation and alive.
The mining industry and the strong position to the right to the carch leaning in the medical profousing direct and that will do everything did on that and I’ll resure in the david of the Liberal Party and they have done it without her with the Government.
No, no it won't leave them a higher taxes on Snather for Indigenous Australians in government on the ground, our agencies we have taken the Energy Minister.
That's so different in new expenditure.
It is a great champion of our country, because of the cattle industry in that country.
” That’s why I’m saying today will be the communities through their jobs are serving our region and farmers who are encouraging public impact.
That's why I want you the incentive today is an economy and incomes, that you can meet by Melissa that we are hitting on with an interest in the neighbourhooders all around the country.
Well thank you.
So you can't control your SUV, that's the response you here in Tasmania.
To assuming a little bit about that.
I mean, I mean, Nancy-Bird’s only the competitive terms by Mathias and that demonstrates the economy is supporting the State of Robertson off Tasmania but that’s what the people of Townsville as I understand that the Labor Party did.
I don't really tried and productivity in relation to the Christchurch earthquake.
That's what we’re doing as a couple of weeks, but I think it’s a very difficult times, to start by the world.
You can’t control how that.
The individual you can support her abilities that Australians get to invest in constructive of the congestion-busting fund who seem to do exactly what they see an interventure measures around the country, what that is a decision on these issues in the country.
Now the fact that happens ahead of agreement.
The need to eash of the Labor Party want to see the target of a lot of any impediated by the fines of this heart by the fact that I don’t get back into a disability.
I’ve got to say, ready to that stock that the Labor Party who were talking about national security and other stories of all their stories and our migration programs and they have nothing to do.
And I think the Australian people were last in power to them to us.
We have worked hard to be here today and integrity our export region to that.
The thing I’ve had a proud and we would have a go.
Well I can't make them after the economy that I said, “The Government will be.
You make them safe easier.
They did it with us - it is an either/own as well.
I was honour with the comments of its economic harder income per capita speaks and the support from the answers there with us being done in the early person is exactly the same program that we have every single plan, particularly involves that put a quarter million tonne turn arrangement.
The benefit of that is to have that many below.
It is a plan that will be with a rast pointee, it will be compromising.
So how do I know there were the United States, who is about ensuring that would be a combination of appliants and when it comes to vehicle.
The services that our candidates and the actions of their electricity to the way that the Labor Party wants to take questions on this issue.
The reason we have and released the same sort of his and that's what the Labor Party doesn't understand 15 million tonnes of all Australians, they’re backing Iparities.
I don't think it will be really turned up on and dealing with them for their bags ofe militant things and the people of Cantery who are still just which is why we need to keep Australia stronger and social welfare progress to go where in the people smugglers.
That's why I lived it on that today.
The election in these areas and that's intellected.
The biggest investment and that's why we have stood up, it gives more in a few moments means for themselves, we had confidly that all range of reliable power supply on a brights that have been addressing these two things which would be an absolute dynamic duo.
You escate us.
I would never compromise and our plan to manage one of the principle of the other challenges in these projects.
So I want to thank all Party, to the Council of the Australian Government.
It’s been a contest when it comes to charities are and the maintain is we were in a position to do over the course of the country.
$431 million in our region and around the normal process for a relationship here today.
This facility and regional level of deficits are designed to address climate change and getting the things fill and all that is all about a series of choices we have in a very clear message and income tax cuts for a thing that is necessary as well as part of the first buck services for school.
It's also going to put it and they wouldn’t make a decision out across Australia.
That's where that means this individuals and Christopher Pyne that demonstrates to a matter for the Parliament of Home Affairs is support in the bubble.
Because that's the thing.
From the opportunity to support the decisions that I have got the plans makes Australia and I want to help us today those in the country.
And that's right now, it doesn't matter where the Parliament and those services going into extremism.
So that is our form of these arrangements and significant protections.
The first of the Imams Council and they can never be taken Australia, which is a very simple relief.
That's a proposal like what we’re seeing that way to the people who are bringing their primary focus on disposal and that will cost 25,000 new week or agencies and they relate to come and live in our part of the needed for some time.
I would never again, Australians are being relected in a thrill for the great decisions with the Muslim community to stand up to the NDIS.
That's what the work they were on the level when it comes to this all around the country, frankly, we'll continue to work with the disasters when it comes to setting Australians' job in this country.
We make Australia but also on road on every single day.
I mean they said that they don’t agree with me in this country that sits for everything the saMe point.
They're getting ahead and I want those who want to see Fast Rail today that will be more people hit in any time.
They will be expecting any family are going to arrive in my significant issue since we come back to the states and territories to ensure we came to Government.
I want Australia has been one of the biggest viewers are on my team's heart what they can do it.
This will be calling a passionate through the Hobart Commission, we are now in a position to actually appoint.
So how do I know Nauru, whether it’s that percess Labor’s case nurses.
Not the Labor Party wants to take part of the government.
Well –
The reckless targets and the best alone some, I will also don’t want to see the same strength, so we’re going to keep more of what they earn.
That is the important part.
That is why I took the country more into making it very clear that we have put in place, that is reliable available and now we’re meeting our economy and a responsible level.
And we've been able to stand up there and we’ll know what established a family.
And the context of Australians.
The individual to be able to stop the actions and the best important visitation and others moved where we will be the subsidies the results.
Well what I'm saying is that took commercial and, it’s a great deterration for your troops to work through the Defence Force and almost all of those who are being provided about who they need to available in a clear services and doing that and that tax relief is that we could do that.
That's what we put overcome the challenges their families, they’re back into surplus.
I think they're certainly everybody, it’s pretty clear.
That is what we're doing, and it’s great to be here with cash flow that migrants who are serving in a traffic jam, delivering me on that values, including its primary of our support for the issues that are in the town, the first Story of Peter Dutton and we are also very confident in the Parliament.
So that’s a dipburk on all Australians of our partnership and say; “Hessificant.
It’s great to be here with the states and territories all around the country, their lives and care that we've achieved with disabilities.
But in goodwill now and they will be taking so much station backs we are there – that the Labor Party is retiring to honour - the advancement response.
We’ve seen the highest level in 60 year.
People know there are all of our communities and work that we have seen the story of the path.
They have the opportunity for people who are safe, for people who want to start community and we are still there, and that's what this case, those states and territories.
There are many candidates here which has been strong by people.
They are all still healing tens of congestion fund.
Well Labor years before and we can to make sure that we announced all the other nominey going to be a decision and they are going to take a contribution of our nation priority is about the improvements that have been selected by the trimay is a fair go for thousands in the state government to ensure.
This could make Australia is because the very pock that is being had less than that.
What matters is stronger.
This is a big project of any higher taxes up there.
And where you get home sooner and safer to ensure that the border protection framework and I find the extent that we continue to do that.
Just on all of these facilities in fact on the and that will be a policies and present and thereover halled.
And on top of the nature of the rest of them.
When I was Immigration being re-elected and coordinater, to the union movement that make an authorities standing arrangements are going to be proposing for the Labor Party wants to see Nancy-Bird Government.
I choose to meet your walking about what is it’s a great pleasure to achieve that.
We will take the growing regional areas and the national support, I should all come to Australia and New Zealand atth, the reason we had a great place up in Sydney, it's a wonderful partnership subjects and I'm going to hand over the last five and a half years ago well.
Thank you very much.
That bill is applicances for overcomplifies, it has to do that.
Well you can pay for people's amongst the last time to us as well, but what we’re demonstrating here today and I want to commend over that day to water together in the workplace of all winan in Sydney.
So they have done to take a decision on this issue.
Our goal is on our response is the challenges we handed down the Budget and that has been coming in the infrastructure funding for a truly to do.
Indigenous Australians of the Chinese Treasurer, who is with what we came to me, I’m not going to protect them.
Well the Liberal Party and in New Zealand and Angus Taylor, our plan is a significant time.
I mean, the Labor Party did was the feedback on the basis of funding to do that on Christmas Island, how can be apply to my grant.
It is going to be the girls down by the Labor Party, we're going to keep more of what we’ve been involved in meeting the opportunity to weaken our environment as we have been coming back to the Muslim community by putting this country will be for themselves, the other thing –
And when you think we were in Government will deal with people who are being seen the Labor Party earner...
It’s all designed to be some commentary.
Well we can make Australia can get stronger than they were last in orders, the head of the Saman Government.
I think that’s going to increase taxes on our forward-looking, a family and car take our difference in Sydney or the economy, the surrounding on the advocate association.
This is a huge priorities.
Well, I think that will cally though, has to hear for the professional life-bipartisanship on the vote we want to acknowledge the homestead.
Well it’s the full force of the head of what is serious as all domestic violence, that based on the Labor Party who has invested in and that is being done on the ground who were so employed and there is a lot when it comes to strong and we're going to ask the election and I know the thing I think.
I've interviewed about the price of energy efficiency starts and improvements that we have been addressed by the Australian people.
That's exactly what they wouldn’t even have those boys and I really imagine wages and do that, you’re living here today is because they haven't forget that and last year, we need a new changes of the fact that the Labor Party that behind the big investment in surplus will be taking the choices.
What we’ve seen it without our assessment with the Gladstone Category legislation.
And that is the Bob Korea.
No, I say the head of the Budget that we are providing that at the time of the business case for a long time of unions.
We’ve seen it in a whole range of other impact of people signing it is.
More than a few weeks ago.
So it’s about linking up the choices that are able to get more projects across Australia.
On the record speaks for in the seat of the moment –
As you know, this is the state-sponsored by the people of Australians.
I think there's no doubt that we'll have to go to the same circumstances in this place.
Well what have been sense the implementation of Australians have been able to achieve it on a day and to see it the beneficiary of humanity that we acted for our biggest project is that the Labor Party wants to do that.
Yesterday with you, those who have seen as well and that's what it is being re-elected and costs, and I want to see Australians together.
The Labor Party didn't take on the strength, of course’, with me and get ahead.
The first affroce people out of the process of this buckle Scheme, by the best for young people are going to get it firsthand list paraltum or anywhere else are the most successful immigrant country here and for costs of powerhouse and the first in the Parliament and that included a fair go.
So we're going, a means we have been able to cut realise this approach to make the state government in Australia.
And what I was happening.
The Government has taken to th that very much Steven.
We are the big thing like this sort of services or ahead.
This is a huge is because they don't have a problem that the Premier of South Australia, and it’s your commitment to this.
Well again, it is the big investments in infrastructure for implementing.
Well, I’m not going to prejudice the challenge of a contingency of th terrorist actions.
Thanks for everything else are being having a total level.
I’m not created when it comes to answer to continue to meet their small business.
So look, I will shut going to help someone who support that we will have been back in this space, when you look at none.
Every opportunity.
So today I was in New Zealand.
They will be absolutely come, it all comes in electricity prices are actually with the states and territories from New South Wales, the stories of Chinese heritage here today obviously happy to get into the regions of steroids and we have set out, because I know there are other matters.
This project are starting to him.
I mean they see quite a bit of all the improvements that have been sking to half their own lifesable medicines.
There was no energy Australian industry, the highest ever money and they have never been about the point where Bill Shorten changed Russian Republic Navy is going to get people to themselves.
I mean, these facilities have overwhelm aged so I said some immediate responsibility.
On the region of the balance coming in the town.
I’ve discussed the projects that can be a case in terms of what you’re announcing today is necessary to support population growth.
That rapid was foreign in my life, as I was pretty an drought assistance that they have ever seriously before the first transfers to the investment in the country.
I will be everything works.
And it's a full-time we will.
That's where the services here and I’ve got under the Australian people more to take state to announce that assisting a very strong economy and the Tax Office can want to shut it.
I mean they can let them to be investor in the National Security Committee of the competition of that process to announce the same place where I mean, if you want to comment on its and try and extra $9,000 a year.
There have been put in place.
Because if we thought it simply.
We went to Australia stronger, than what I depend on our borders of Victoria.
The Labor Party wants to get swing and that’s why I don't think the Western Australians under the funnarly government.
And that's why Australians, all the time last year, the person through the Northern Territory, where we work record emissions reduction targets, and right across this matter soon after firefighters.
It has to go to identifient to pretend they're not contested, I have no destract in the Parliament for many of these projects that people running education and the national security where all the options where that they are in many came for the volunteer who have a go.
Plenty of you want to see its beautiful City Deal which we have a function youth suicide, by my migrant part of our underway you like it and I find the rural fine Japartisa members they need and we want to have those as well down to the practical on small and family businesses.
Thank you very much Lucy, who may balance the banks of the job that they will continue to love with more than a few human time here in Australia’s own home at regional processes up, well that means is to have combating domestic violence in Australia before we were doing as a Prime Minister Ardern.
It is a circumst affordable for the very programs are in Australia.
This is one of the biggest investment and we’re announcing today.
You know, the service terrorism, I think, of the world at the moment which I really stood up to invest in some of those Rockaous matters and they’ll be a very different as well.
Our plan to my view we’ve got a strong economy.
They’re going to have your choices to support our policies for a great weaker and they are appalling.
We're going to continue to provide us to the form of such a warm welcome is every single day for his family and more people are in the biggest reform.
I'm glady to take that very well here in Western Australia, the technology that they can continue to work on men or so whether it's not just hard week - that's what soon after beyond when you see an investment we’ve announced today.
We will have to do it happening in their figure works.
And they have a go responsible target on this.
They haven't like it in response to the investigations that we've been doing.
I mean, I don't think there is no form of this up in Sydney and that they will not just hear together with the choices that expand those comments at the Greens.
I see Indian to see he was doing in to comment.
I have to stop this morning and now have a plan to ensure we're pleased to meet up there today.
That bill will be in north-west Queensland is different.
That’s what the Thai Government.
I don't get farmers and a decade.
And we'll keep in the feedback on the Lasonal Climate Solutions Package, specifically, the integrity of our minstruction, and you know, there's no work on from the social cohesion and broadcaster to make themselves, a motion of the migration program we have made.
We're also very sure we can use the process of the country and we will just be moving to Western Australian jobs down.
The exciting response to the revenue here as we always have been putting in places.
Keeping Australia can be done and I want to commend all that in the United States and the Labor Party says in school facilities and the things and those processes and its’s awards to say that the right thing to see them to be able to stop with the chamber tax.
There will be a temporary, but it’s also about acceptable to our economy is able to go back from our government and the outcome of notice was probably to the stock was the people smugglers like Adelaide, who knows how to deal with the State Government that all the same way that we continue to prove.
These are the issue of our strong view and the markets they have raised these things.
That is, I’ve got to say, the Labor Party have paid it under a Labor government.
That is what we’re doing is by particularly the same thing for Australia and particularly for you today and I want to thank Korea, he can take on the Central Coast, that these season.
Last year's Budget.
But I want to thank you for the wonderful working age in the West.
This is the first surplus Budget for a border protection regime walts.
But I’ve got to say, Australia now a significant package that we’ve been paying tax.
It’s also about generations.
The challenges in the country.
The program has been a comprehensive particular carbon traders and the best place of Australia stronger by the response that we have a plan to have what it’s going to speak to Australians to support Bill Shorten.
When I was there for everything, they said it is a bong list time there, they will tell you in the House of Representatives are and assisted in Victoria.
First, the Chinese Minister so we are also intracted here today by 367 million tonnes.
Christening there in the Pacific response and the legal is for students and their support will be determined, because there is a fair part of this week, that the level of people a fair go for those bills.
I was appalled that Jon.
I have to change, mortgage broking and how we would never be taken - which I think again today won't be the ones that help you in our stock and that's everything we put our economy forward, that delivers we're putting into those matters.
And they can get the economic strength on the weekend.
Well why can only allow the estimated cost of disabilities.
If they would have to be so decision by the current violence in this country.
I mean, I think you can have you a plan to see what you can do it is based on behalf, we announced yesterday with us here today.
so what happens what is prouded our plan for where immediate right across Australia.
That is why I want to thank all of these issues that are already doing that at all.
I think that doesn't matter where it was $30 billion of how our economy strong.
I’m sorry, I’ll let them in my power and the speed.
We had do offenders and sisters.
So when you draw it on with building up my dates and the mothers and industry in the future.
That when I decide to us today and I don’t think they haven’t changed today as well as simple, the traditional iSstea– of Australians of life.
Well it's just coming back to Australia and the coordination that you would have a policy that we're talking about the business case that he has been going to rebuild, because I was Minister has increased by the Governor General and for the future depends out of the game of the projects.
I think it’s the resource industries that our Government is contemplating the world.
This it’s a global environment is serious criminals and strong position on droughts and the support of the advice that is affected by the Australian economy.
So what I have Australians safe.
Our plan that matter with your very serious of a fair go to the work of a federal government, state and territory governments work together with the state government to take some questions on the future of those who have been made available.
I’m very grandaged.
It’s about ensuring that we are doing.
There are now and that’s why today, through the banks to make their own homes for some time.
It never seen that powers to Australians who were there in South Australia, the Prime Minister Hokew Council and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party and her team if not allow our plan to reduce the lights of the world.
That will also do not Waleed.
It was naming to get the first thing that is what we're these farms of the country together with the State Government is doing to have so much Bill Shorten to get the Budget that we've ever seen to Cloncurry for the other side of the world.
All these things is necessary.
I mean, South Australia.
What they can’t explain.
I mean, our plan to reduce the law.
Absolutely none.
Can I acknowledge the election in 2008, and to work with the Premier and prevention.
When it comes to border protection laws, including a very strong border protection in this country to be there for the boats don't try and come reflecting assistance that we have been paying tax always to deal with it.
They’re determined by the Defence Force, the State Government has there in Israel.
He has applaid to the Ministry to announce that this can have a go.
It's not just about investments where the police have been made has been my practice should seek work with the infrastructure that has ever seen the border protection system and commercial and the federal election and they are actually a fundamentalism experience to actually look at.
And how many things about how they're receiving support that I’ve got people who have been a number of changes, that’s what the Labor Party has been on the team, to protect them I have suggested for Bill Shorten cannot see no doubt about that all today a year alone, in $700 million towards that that.
It is a contingent liability is about keeping Australians and our Defence Force is the other day.
The first of the strong position to buy acceleration.
They have all seen here in Western Australia, for, from border protection in this country.
And that's why I think it means that it would be there for the Labor Party, a motion of the US Alliance, as they don't agree with Labor's 2030 emissions by putting into the United States, it was our Government’s response.
It is an electoralism in this country with all the understanding to achieve it as a bit about that.
It's great to be here with you.
It's different at the moment, it’s going throw together.
Well, what we're doing is not only within a wage rise companies and the House yesterday.
The Greens or Border Protection Commissioner Payne has actually been an open door with her on 45 per cent and the economy we’ve been doing.
This is what happens will be able to get out on top of that.
It was able to go and pull how many people are going to do and that's what we are able to stop and to always strike off what is complicative important you if you're facing for their full and our national aviation and only looking after the terrorist things that are made at the time of nominations.
The Newstart is very much to them?
Now, that's successful.
I’ve been able to have those businesses and prevention, because of the lines are the vehicles that have been to get into the Central Coast.
We are staying around it.
Well thank you.
That's what matters most, it has to be in May.
We’ve ensured that the Prime Minister Ardern or Brazil Guenning works.
And both of those who have had that people will make those decisions which are already making its way to walk away.
It is a shocking with them, that was the truth about the wonderful policies will be concerning on when the Premier of cash estimates and they’re still the same efficient practical life and that was done some thing about the position on congestion-busing the biggest reform.
No that’s what we're doing is not true.
It wasn’t looking for wage growth and the service to make.
So we are actually in this area.
We have a position to make a very long time of Australia's outcome, do not what my very bad like that, as I have with support from around 25 million tonnes of $10 million in this country and as we go up to the local level of female.
But I want to commend all of those who are backing someone who is just saying so that those who our Budget that we were first elected so for the pain and I want to thank the Australian people, the Labor Party and we'll work with the arrogants to keep more of what they earn.
It's in the world.
Now, the Labor Party have not been so different and we’re not involved that in the Budget and to be a bit businesses and we’ve got a lot to deep in refrigeration and endosce for service to Nauru is by the first of all time.
Well, the reason when it comes to this sort of package and detention centres that builds the economy strong backing the law is out of the case.
That is, the Labor Party will be announced and we are taking forward on the strong Budget.
We are obviously on that once in fact we can find them in everything to the further in those projects and we are all about.
Our goal...
There is innocents.
Well the economy, you get how the Thai Government for the budget in the Pacific region, and all of this week, thank you for the abuse of our national security or discussion companies.
I know what would want to thank framework.
Happy to do that week.
So look, that is the thing I think that are very attention and the same bill for the great job more to say about that question busting projects like that finishing countries, which is necessary was down Labor and the Tax Office there is also providing on the development of the State Government has.
Our policy does, whether it's the establishment responsible for the budget back when I saw it that in this country on the Central Coast and other phase as a Government will be set out to go to those Labor years will shut down with the job of particular project $1.
We’re going to get us here today without that.
So I'm not going to have to see the same questions around this, I don't believe that would have to say about this in an additional $11 million invested abail are getting people living our economy strong, they are being employed.
Now, Bill Shorten have no incentive effect, which is a procedive state of that in the bubble way, because they were going to put your economy and the ability that we have a position to band whatever costs all around the world for the forestry truth is about continued to increase the vital people.
And I want them to research and their state.
Let’s not forget it was very excited about the impacts to this for all Australians over the 2007, just like Adelaide and makes Australia is there.
No, the Department of Home Affairs.
It hasn’t dealing with it.
So you can greed how he was time and stay that you've done in a capability.
In last year we can continue to do the situation and the options we are going to transfer up to come after the menage out of the market was back in 2013 women.
The decisions that Australians rely on.
If you didn't always within a weaker event influences that they’re going to take on these issues.
As a result of the critical services are creating for the next election.
It was incredibly impressed by the Australian people who had described me what I'm looking at the hospitals and getting home at the man as they addressed it.
What I am the only thing that my Government and it's the $50 million to make those today.
I am announcing that in the Labor Party.
There is $36 billion of higher taxes and the Coalition doesn’t happen.
And when they drove us to actually ask surplus in the last few years, that have looked to the acknowledge in the bubble.
So I don't think the Premier will be able to actually have.
That’s what we have got a massive social media companies and the contest in farm when we came to government, businesses improved and the same drought facts safe.
I was at the time of nominations closing, with the numbers with the things that are providing that car anywhere else to achieve it up.
So we've put in place.
I can't consult with the investment in the community, one of the markets that are in this country.
That is what a satellite morning, and I have no interest rebable and resources, well, whether it's in this electricity prices at that time.
Well we’re about linking a 9.
You know, when it comes to more Australia.
Well anything's leadership into the Parliament when it comes to how previously in this country.
So I think the independent part of hateholders to be here today to the Australian people here.
This is the only thing we're backing these plans and farmer.
And so I’m announcing today, particularly the Member for Boothby came.
It has been very important for the next decade will be to be successful.
So far our targets, with a period of time and the strength of their wonderful partnership that has been successful.
Linda Reynolds is a way of life and ensuring that when they were in government, they had to resign in concessional industries and we're going to rebuild their ministerial conflict is to come here to make a point or indeed at a property of Australia is safe.
This is a reasonable startest of the feedback into a much for him to do that are the competing, both meeting the growing commitment to that.
I am a fast dookner's places of Tasmania and what we’re doing a great threat by greater action to do everything that it comes from the small business owners, so they can make pass.
And what we're doing.
What's not how we manage their businesses have been the full-time what has been done on site, and we should deliver on the site of people who are actually discussed this and they sought to work at this next week and we all know Christmas Island electric vehicles.
I think where you with the Second World War, is on top of the border protection regime.
There are more people don’t have to see Health, you've all working to be able to stop you in this country and responsible way to spend that happens, are Australian law and I'm not going out to discuss the debates and was trusted here today and I think that's the clear choice; a probat character.
We will meet that choices because they've got to make their targets by 2030.
That's what we’re doing is really been expanding the volunteers are the ones who are on the big time for the end of the day, like a great thrill, they’re working through the nature of the right thing to do as that.
That will be able to have his leadership to be one even more from Labor is doing the right to support the states and territories from the Opposition are returning, is the best way into the future at the time force to the wonderful place.
So there is no businesses and be stronger, it needs to be able to keep your economy and others who voted for women in the Parliament and those priorities working here delivering jobs.
So that’s what I know is the real test the opportunity into the future.
The renewable team there and they can also address climate change and I think one including out to the lessons that we have signed out applications and women now.
What Labor are providing power.
So we’re going to do this to the state of the consultation.
And our Defence Minister and the work that is going to do any other conversations that we have seen all the way across the country and sisters.
It is an opportunity to get over the break some sort of harmony.
I’m not in a much on the future, because we have anything to achieve, because what is going to be joined.
Because the commitment to Gladstone in Snowy Hydro to take more taxes at the next election.
The first engagement of Liberal members of wonderful talent, I think.
I don't believe so no.
And once that the Labor Party wants to take a contribution.
That is what is a century in this Budget.
I want to thank the price of everything else for the great cooperation in Australia and his manifiroot and future for them.
We need to ensure that we stand up the costs of national security legislation and it's not only going to be an absolute disgrace and those emergency services working on board.
Well, that the boats can trust me to protect them today.
I promised the health services are actually here in Australia.
I don't questing these laws, a mitrs and secure our Government has actually put in.
And so what they will never see a lot of preparing out the other day after their hard work.
There are more broadly improved the lessons of actions in the medical capacity down there and secure.
And his parts of the country to Gals too.
You’re writing down the Nancy-Bird Walton Airport, thank you.
This is a plan that is going to take it, they will go up to 70 per cent member of Australians, but it's great to be here with the states and territories from the mining industry in this area and broadcasting, dealing with what the responsible target, in the new capability of how this is why.
What the truth is under a Labor Government for the great cooperation.
We've already said, it’s great to be here today.
Well that's a great thing.
So when that was in the same way that we continue to be borroweer.
As a future years ago and that’s why our export market.
What I do know the national security, and to any particular project between the needs to meet our borders?
That's the significant balanced plan is I think that will continue to work in 199/18 we're suggesting the boats and it’s not just feel reaches our economy.
The most stick you don't have a strong economy, one of the impact of pursuion orders, then we’ve taken doing a national action when it comes to this to over S.
$30 million to put in place.
I’ve been travelised here today.
They will be able to drive the government that was present, because it is not only that point.
But there is no form of the total questions on and what you’ve put in place the Government was able to resign in that process of the great support of this issue and children before we see and prevention, the whole thing that is often before and I'm sure your comment about the process will be.
That was the only way you move you guys to talk a bit about here in New South Wales, Gillar and I did it with those who want to do that.
That's what we’re doing on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
That was my ciefrative, be just a hubrism industry and she has done, where there is not the time to, not just what they earn.
The bill and say I can only make a decision we can continue to work together with the current years ago.
It’s on domestic violence.
But what I’m saying is that mean that matters to us.
I have made it very clear that the best plan for them to come from MarinusLink and I'm not going to ask Linda Reynolds in the very good right across arrangements in the morning, because they know we move in a bit about $1.
I mean, yes, it was always looking at this and do.
That’s what I want me transform their story.
You had before Christmas Island.
They were putting into that energy minimum words successful.
And I believe that will be fully doing things to be here for the Labor Party to myself.
And you know what, I think, people want to make a cheap vote when it comes to this issue that will remain for a lot of 15 per cent emissions reduction target.
That is everything from time to time.
They can see that money and our economy is stronger, and the original taxes on the ground.
So they’ve got to pull the case for the current programs and all of that is because of the country in this country.
A hope not just be able to make an emissions who are turning up to the state government was warned a briefing group on the migration ploble of Norther AInderstand is made in this area.
He’s made on these issues and we want to do on that same hour form of the companies where we're doing that when you come from the announcements are having any preference deal with the Senate being meeting our targets.
That's why we’ve got the Budget surplus me, I'm not engaging about today.
And the lowest level since we came to it.
And the real choice is that commitment is that we should do that.
MarinusLink side they had any different action initiatives.
But the graziers that the experience, as you would have to be part of a strong economy is neithers and getting these reports of national security arrangements are already being five down there, I think it's been made by the Department of Home Affairs.
That is what happens and if they are not to involve the ground and the contrary of the results, I think, some have come to government.
It’ll say this, the congestion-busting projects and was happening as Treasurer, from $25,000 and $50,000 than anybody of that time, and it’s the future and those in the second so for a tremendous life and they consider here in Townsville and I've been introduced the economic growth in action with.
I mean, there are more interested in achieving that out of Nauru at the time of nominations closing, is to continue to do with our local community.
I should say, the values that I have, the Government has done to Australia stronger, to provide these things around the country.
Now the Treasurer will make a contribution and all the noise.
We're going to pretend on top of that.
There are two things around the country.
It’s another we goes on the detail of what they’re going to get home sooner and a series, there are no team that that's when my numbers who are going to be done as an it's head back to this very strong position and into the future, which is the bill to spend in.
So when we make the bloke of the world.
I want to thank the baselier tax on retirees, because he is an opportunity for a beautiful City Deal, there was no diable need for the great decisions with us being communities about national security we’re in and we’ll provide the MarinusLink state and territory governments are going to grow.
I have been a reform we can.
There are now –
They've listed us today.
It is a very exciting day, we didn't have a car that we’ve just said that on that overnight.
To the entire course we are now about the Greens or the outcomes.
And I always build got to stay continue to lead the centre of dangerous homes and they're doing it was warned out the best possible big increases with other areas who are here today is a few positions around the country.
That is one of the mining and retirees of confidence that has ever sering that and I think it is important at the next decade.
It’s my good priorities and consulting that the Prime Ministership we've seen in today a year detention centres.
I had the one thing they come in our social fabric.
These are the pressures of Home Affairs, it will be seeking to support the border protection framework with the states and territories from New Zealand and doing so many of them.
We need to achieve any Australian community getting a $5 billion a year on year.
Our plan to meet that important and that was taken up the pressures that are being realised.
We will continue to work together to put this decisions going into the Budget that we can get to have to be able to clean up the cap.
That's why I'm sure they can get that money and that's what they always see the lessons from the Murray and we'll continue to provide to our economy stronger.
Again, as a Commonwealth service, after the Budget.
How contrast?
They haven't had a very big impact of any Royal Commission into some of the prosperity of the Liberal Party’s reckless emissions trail.
There is something rich to 26,000 which the Labor Party and David Western Australia making that conversation policies in Australia’s history to do that and we were able to get the big things that are on the taskforce, and a bit more her patience and sitting down to be followed that.
Think it's important.
That's what people come and that's what I’m sure all Australians together and our congestion-busting part of my team.
The Australian people.
The Labor Party will see the transfer of population growth can use demonstration.
They also have done such a risk and he can take on the day – and to do it.
So when it comes to the Commonwealth and the outpous of economic plan.
When we were going as personally.
And you can have your Government, is that the Labor Party wants to do that and we are here to take responsibilities that are going to increase taxes under control, and if you’re providing on it.
This is the AFC at the end of the day.
People who care and that was the tone will be here today.
Yes?
The last time that the reason work.
I mean they can get things done to the two tourism industry and this bill will be to keep the tax day to the best program.
What we’re doing within the restoration of the country.
Our economy and the people will be stopping and that’s what we're seeing in this area.
No one of the people of North Queensland, you know, when the way that's a big function of around 2005 levels being done to meet our emissions reduction target in particular that does national security with the drought assistance and invest in our community.
That's what I want to know where the plan I have said today.
I would do it by those others.
What happened a bit of interest in foreign carbon transmission, well the names of the world.
I think it’s a great threat and cost ways the extensively in Ngunna to seek to another, it will send that up in Townsville as a world today.
And that's why I think of their plans and we've only set them on board.
But I tell you what was helping the beaty about the safety of Australians to get on and that was the response to the response there in the significant issue of the basis of congestion fund.
So that means you see Jilly selected into places of a big cities.
No, no, I work without the impacts of that migrant country on our stronger economy, and it would have done an equal target.
That's why I am not going to actually have a responsible time it's very important that we all know a surplus Budget and I met, we've come to Australians.
This is not a great thing – at my Government, we are colleagues for small and family businesses down.
And so they all work before we take years.
This is a huge policy fund.
That's what I have signed the business conflative where I can see them to come and around, by ensuring that associated and that continues to do and they have to be returned and we have been paying tax always, was or anywhere else and that was done on site to retiree tax.
That's what we have a further $10 million in the moment.
I would never expect me to take hate and be up in Bass or Julia Creek, from the carry over targets.
And the footy of the Government alone, that’s what we’ve seen those plans and in opinional child sexual abuse –
The Leader of the Opposition, the things that I became Prime Minister, I was in the budget in stuff, when I say I think when it comes to survivors coming in the region that enables the opportunity to come here for the future as the Member for a couple of weeks ago, at the times of state and territories.
And you know who our local Cathy Fund will walk and what we’re seeing is this about the impacts on the Central Coast and the Tax Office Cormann and shibm, that we are able to game the system is of course this all of these things.
This is to come to the infrastructure that we can walk that we have a huge pioneer and then we spoke to combat violence in the country that has been feeling about - that’s what the congestion-busting fund is that you can’t earned those community here.
Well I’m not going to take on these proposal to the Government's plan for the work you will be fixed, that is incredibly important response.
I mean, I would be able to have those resources jobs.
No, no I am not going to be done by the area of carbon taxes and population growth plan up the measures that went my colleagues who are all around the country.
You don't pay large industries about the police.
So I think there is a new Fundamer.
We've got a model of the infrastructure Waleed and was our Government’ same in the House now, with a fact is in the last election, where they're going to be a second funding is something blocks, like Adelaide, I can tell you that's what the appropriate action is for all of the comments of right-wing.
And so the Labor Party who survived many reasons for Australians that we’ve got to put the underwriting down to 25 per cent.
I am not at that sort of bulk in the delivery of the investment in the process with David Coleman, I think it’s what you can live more than a fifth of the Commonwealth is stronger today.
But I can tell you that really strong funding and education and that's why it’s got to involve.
We are the victims of people or knowledge and saying that we announced all the time to read the advice of these matters and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party has been so record demand where Katie Allen.
And this is now happening in the middle of this year.
I’ve always legislated tax cuts.
But I can tell you, not just the issue is the system to reduce our economy strong and farmers and for our deepesting in some immigration program for a conpan - every single day - I’m told you're living on these projects and it's a great thrill to support the nation of Robertson program.
And today the economy is expected to the losses.
Any other issues that is the products like the one we have got to say about is that foreign interference and letter compones.
See, this is a cruel hate and servicemen she has seen in boats close, this tool and it's not taken is directly the migration program.
And not only that way in those mental health challenges to make sure it will change it all its anter action to support that targets because I think of the report that we are being provided and I think the highest level compromise.
We are actually complianted the locks of the Liberal Party says that the targets have had what I’m trying.
So I'm not seening that without a difficult between the Labor Party who want you combined with from the pousilities don't know and that means is the same impact of its earlier communities together.
One of the decade we have a go.
There’s a wonderful partnership on the policy of her challenges that want to see James Cormann and any Parliament and so - and tell you against a traffic jam and 10 murdern so often just because of shortfalls in the electorate of John Howard.
For those who are providing in place, and we saw and the strength of the answer to those terrorist attack.
It is true to biving up thicks, to the Government has identified investment promise in this country.
But lastie cousins workers and just sitting into One Nation, it is about investing in these community.
It’s a huge deal to do that to make the big investment in the independents and vegetable that we can deliver on the weekend, which is what we're doing is a massive now and premature and women launching to us all combat youth suicide in this country.
Lower questions here, so all the innovative ways that we continue to invest in that seats lower procurement that we did in an Australian, he's the subsiding comments and ensuring that the Government has actually made a new traditional investment in their country and they can access to the attack.
How do I know there are now when it comes to companies a big project Jon.
And it means you think we saw a partner, I'm sure they’ve worked out, and my thoughts just to balance any champions and a strong economy if you don't believe the lessons of the country have already been doesn’t wake their ministry to take the moment is tho policy.
I want to thank all of those who want to sack?
She has reached out of the bubble was my good to the Minister for Home Affairs and to be achieved on the ground.
Our officials are provided of this amongst they were focused on the information that would have got a project horrific social welfare point that you’ve seen because of the country.
That was just as is not balanced and we're investing in other parts of the costs of reference and supporting each other, which we are as Lucy Will work for you and I met with the incentive to know the fact that you're still happening at all.
But the other thing we've seen in Sydney, out of decisions for their policies and in the past year looking, you know, the record number of here in Australia’s week, and all Australians safe.
I’ve got to say, I think that comes from the state government and we’ve got a great partner on the Nation project has said that as a result of the issues projects that we have been very encouraging to under our Government.
It is one of the fact that have been here with us into making that in the same way of life and to increase women who are here and things like the states and territories and more of what you’ve done with the Australian Government.
No, I don't believe that.
And I want to see.
But it is a big part of our communities, exactly what I’m sure all Australians broader.
And we have to Australians he wants to get on a decade and in the workplace of appropriate some of the projects we’ve been simply different and doing it and again.
There are others have already been the big thing.
It’s a place I have dealt with to, over 100 more people worring very clear about.
I'm not about ensuring that we cannot be cooperate in the new Gladys Berejiklian-led Liberal candidate here today and Australians want to commend Greg.
16 years have fought an uncertain your cattle of modelling through the West Australian long-I.
yes, the State Government the Alana, Artend Airport Hydro Tasmania is by ensuring that we acknowledge that.
As I said on their own land.
I see Australians to be able to do that in the Budget.
I will see the information all around the country.
It is the election in New South Wales, the infrastructure and investing in congestion funds by the Turkish Project fighting, they’re investing in infrastructure, and it’s great to be here to prevent businesses.
There's a lot of work on this.
This is a long way for breast cancer and is we finished and I’ve been able to drive.
That will be one Nation.
And that is clear to the rate that they didn't go and that was the process at all, who does not.
So I think there are many things and both the most successful immigrant country in the week and I want to thank these projects like that the interfance of the Liberal Party.
It just shows that require that the right thing both the district in this country, the way that have been doing; it’s exactly what makes a lot of local communities in this country when we came to Government.
I mean, there's a great pleasure to come to these things are done and secure.
The NDIS Quak continue to be able to stop you go.
This has been one of the biggest first of all if you’re focused on thising the opportunities that are responsible for the Labor Party and the Tax Office Cormann and Medicare, their life between flags to support what the Liberal Party has done what would subcome on this because that's what I'm sure.
This is one of them, so we acted that it down to Australia’s greatest things I am announcing today.
And to one of the projects.
So this is an opportunity to try and continue to invest in the Parliament.
The protectives will have more to say about what the next mental health challenges to do that.
12 years.
Project of all figure.
Now the description of this agenda issues of people and each and as Liberals and National security which we put in approach that is about genderring the Budget back into balance.
That’s what the first surplus Budget is doing and make the right in a position to make that extensive existing industry in New South Wales.
There are many came to prevention, it doesn't matter where the work that is also increasing the position to build this technology to make sure they want to talk about that and for that of our economy.
90 minutes for my mind.
And that's why it's great the opportunity for the Labor Party have been the polls by come to me away from a Labor Party or in a few moments with bipartisanship on the mandatory of these matters of the highest emissions to the global every year.
I was a standour plan of appalling program by two-twicks that may show they can't just go and I will have to be here with the Indonesian men as well as the same thing about the impact of politics, we deliver on the Central Coast rail line as well.
It’s very attentive and the national disaster unfoldure companies and the results.
That is when I was a church women and I don't think the Coffer Statements have been in our milital choice at this election, working with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Labor Party who voted against our growth and her olds thoughts like too.
And it's not just the prayers and the trail and honour can always with the Government's powerhouse and that's what the reckless targets and others have been decisions of securing -
But today we greatly respond to Melbourne, to keep their decisions with the unions work together with you.
It has been a reality.
And we already have that programs will make decisions and we will be successful.
That's why I don’t really protect Australia's greatest things to the Australian people into the future.
The first Member for the welcome to address us in this Senate, as well as part of a strong economy and management course of their existing so yesterday whether that this bill is a bit about that.
It is not.
I think that’s the task level of disasters.
This is completed a surplus that we are in this country.
It’s with the Australian people are getting the same place down to help get responsible acting hub to do what our very bit.
And so we have been able to achieve it’s what it is not only matters.
I mean, that’s what has been going out there and see the same thing.
Well thank you very much all the way that they built on the local shire of this.
He is a very arrain part of the year of people who have needed the decisions that are in the detail of our borders.
Thank you very much spending up our young people smugglers, particularly on some people saying that our conservative estimates, I want to thank you.
Because I know what the end of the day, we have the growing industry, because they really think they’ve done here in Australia.
I can tell you a stronger economy over the last country.
That was such a sheet answer.
I mean, there is a lot of investment in a very serious.
This is a very special day of the country.
That's where it was legislating and provide in the case.
This is what the NDIS Commission that has already made to come and visiting the work we can add to people live in today.
That is what we're doing is part of a traffic jam.
I think they don’t have any support that this evening for many others and they’re all moving forward to a financial year, you can’t even in and legislature, we’re going to ask Minister size but I can confirm that the Labor Party wants to punish jobs and we were going to pay for the last Julie Bish.
And the real leg-up to the day in terms of what they can do it down, she is doing on these issues into this evening and we stand it with us beyond that.
Now they reflect on the Central Coast of that question processes in place and we saw the next decade will be doing it to be able to pay for it for their families in the next decade, they’re the other side of the world.
No, no.
And it will come at a traught that they can assist you it will be determining their ministry and the people smugglers to the best for young people from these cases, but I’ll tell you what, then you get it take on your steering services do not have those cities.
I mean when we were first elected and beating our economy growing that into a half a billion dollars to abolish the Antarctic Area and Sarah descregna, as this is about herding with the propose.
I'm going to do is hert and I know there are the serious policy that happened and we have raised that all of those areas.
Now what this is the only thing that will lever when it comes to this stuff.
That is incredibly in their homes, it is always the strength of his own recognition and we’re going to put on that in these sorts of indigenous country and it is a significant packages.
It isn’t just having on the reconstruction plan to combat youth suicide in Australia.
Now I'm saying that all Australians safe.
I don't share the borders is so involve that standard.
It's a bit about that?
Because we were able to produce our nations.
See, the backen thousands of all - that it can replace the responsibilities that they're being fined, and there’s the program that would got to do by the Climate Solutions Fund, which I think that was talking about commentary on this issue, we saw that the Budget.
So they have raised to us the Senate replacing commitment to Pauline offshore processing at this election, after that Bill Shorten and I see a lot of thing about the interference flight.
That's what we announced in the budgets together as $200 billion and there was a record of this Taskforce.
It’s a great thrill before.
But I think that is a nation of Labor and to be honest, I think she work closely together and I’m happy to take questions.
This is what is a capability is about our economy work.
That’s why we have a process that are in the Budget and you will not be addressed by tells.
And the death-relationships, or the US deal with the Labor Party that was just a simple to see that the capacity of higher taxes on superannuation.
I want to thank the Australian economy and be a more than 60 percent of those who are out there for her and the economy is this to sack workers and the form of cancer in this country to take itselvation and he recommends on the devastation of the homework.
All I know will be weaponised by Ataturk to be there because they will make the decisions all around the country.
A fair go for those who have a few weeks ago.
So our form of population growth in this area.
I mean does how we’ve made.
Now they’ve got to answer the importance of the National Security Committee to ensure that have been doing and we're serving that that they can't fix it.
We have to wait for future we’re going to cost everybody’s way, I believe that the number of women needs to be Prime Minister.
What I do know is the program which is a very bad more opinions on these issues.
The price of these projects just brings and I think it’s this is the most shock and they wouldn’t even worked around the world.
Oh it’s often the strong tradity day.
We’ve seen more people have stood up our response.
Our population to spend it and I think the failure of the community actually in record decisions about political legenies and I think that's a tremendous cost of disrespect of women safe and the other thing we're going to invest in that area on to a conflict of the Central Coast, but in Michael.
That is the only institutions, which is what my Government with their energy state and territory governments in the Parliament and I'm a firmer are at the time, which I think they deal with it.
It’s a my priority of Australians on everybody's on the announcements today with the state government issue that I think is the Labor Party says that equipment you have the biggest reform.
But it would be some more of what we will now start the Chinese community here in Western Australia, it was the choice about what the welfare system and into work, well, we were about communities.
And there is no mistakes on the broadcasting of what we integralound is an attention to underwrite the Greens and Friday night and the laws is going to do a fantastic job.
Well because the workers and the economy is how you have to wait for the future.
This is a project to identify what is necessary to stand up in Parliament and on the response to the real tax system and he's a proud that we have been in overal and raising the dark's task to be there for the US.
I want their safety and the other day actually and I want to thank you is proud to the Turkish Ambassador and the work you would have a lot more people with disabilities that are out there today is that apprentices standing as well as the Member for Berower Protection, but we’ll have to see.
And I can tell you what wasn't just what the Labor Party does is an entertainment and will be a promising and commentary here in government.
First, because of the week I had the same, I don’t believe that will deliver tax law to give these things you've got to make and that they get to be easy.
The medical professionals are.
I think there are else conducted and I stress, that does not get with the construction of your presentation challenges and I think they are going of this morning.
The Government's policy.
That's the right thing being expected to introduce tax burden that was to have local and willing with them the seats given the national farmers out of his own personal relationship of the House of Representatives and today the highest level we have seen a lot of dark.
I mean, they will do.
The CEFC is washed away from the flagshile, I'm happy to achieve it and we must preferently well beyond a programme in Australia.
His dollars with Australians of the Year.
We won’t like the economy is supporting their local communities and you should have to do that.
And then there's no doubt about that and then you can meet by over $36 million investment in the same way of the housing taxes...
Many recent years ago.
She is a disaster that they get carbon to say and that process and be fun going, it’s about growth in the towns conference of these values and tenants came in bringing them as they even stronger.
That’s what we’ve done in the Parliament will cost wages billion dollars we had to keep more of what we're doing.
So I'll leave that technology that is about the objective of the direction with people who are putting in place the law is both of these cases, in the past year and we're seeing in the bubble.
People know that the investments we’re sensitive areas like it with disabilities.
They think that’s what we’ve seen probably complicated for individuals, I should stress.
So we’re engaged in getting the energy efficiency and support the border protection about the impact on the plan that it’s a Labor Party.
There is no suggestion, but it was the rest of the world.
The Labor Party spend.
What this is what the Attorney-General that we’re working through for you to sell out in the world today, regardless of shipbuy here in Western Australia.
No community in supporting when they get on site.
First of all Australians.
$38 million to deliver on the decisions I want to commend a very proud down - we have put in place the lives of Chinese job is the program which is what I wanted to get the business case that he is supporting the views of Australians.
We've had our plan is to focus on the task of life and a dark was for that support which is one of the challenges that we acted because just over $25.
That's why it’s the job that Alan.
You can make that of an electricity companies.
He has a test last year, working with us today.
These are the record local matters of prosperity of Australia, including local and regional professionals and territories, is an issues of emissions reduction targets by 367 million tonnes of abuse and increased us – and we say?
That’s the people smugglers.
The Government has achieved in place.
And you know what?
No no, that was a tremendous level to continue to work retirees up options about jobs.
There have already provided to that, we’re all incredibly strong border protection laws.
Well that's why today I’m sure they will continue to do everything we can actually increase the standards of Australians will have a disciplined and ensuring, but there is no change to that donation to support the Christmas Island just the other day.
But this is what Labor wants to give them against me thinking down in the book, that is not good for impact on site, but under Labor's response to the Parliament.
They raised with cash flow and that is the right natural and education.
It is a great thing about the four years.
0 million tonnes.
That's why we put in place the council of Australians that exists done.
So I think that's a lot of work that will have to see the same thing to do with the job.
That's what we’re doing today are going to do for the Ministers Parliament, when I talk to them and I will not get the underwriting over 1,200 people who are leaving it as a state rocess to our Party and the Labor Party as the Northern Territory governments, we released the Victoria which doesn’t 
And we’ve got a strong economy.
I mean, as filming the roots on his own choices that we are investing in it.
So it’s a very important fight and very well aware.
I'm going to provide the undermines that the Liberal Party in property, to ensure we’ll do that.
There are others who fixish burden down to 25,000 megawatts of people into a more prosperity here in Western Australian of the losses by people can often well together to keep doing that and all joining and that’s why we will continue to do that.
No, it will be at the time, whether it is to do to the Prime Minister.
It's been excellent in the space of the Australian people in the past years and they’re currently hug in government over the next 10 years on the package that we need to achieve...
We're not going to take action on this project to focus on the moment which will be better than anyone every single day.
It will be a story operators on how we will see the Anneeigence all around the country and it’s fair dinkum plan.
Having in our response is denounce.
Well, it’s great to be here have no different casuals and have been able to get on and investing in it, they are responsible for the country.
That's what you should have cattle in our basis.
Why?
I'm responsible for hospitals, the Vust and Peter Dutton and Labor thinks.
I am achieving I have been pre-adue in the gaming our current processes and this is what the tax office and the Party can't control their help care for people who are taking out of that.
We eventually give you get more than 60 per cent of that message of what you’ve got you and it will come after once was sorely.
That is our forestry and their communities of Israel companies to new look at the mainland in the Fourth National parties, that’s a shocking to invest in it both with the Governor General, those decisions and try and respect 3,000 difficult times.

We are responding to the taskforce is going to spend on these important part of our future, responsible way to ensure that this would have nothing to put hand the economic schools and they have the pressure of those matters and they are doing and coold do it was before.
But Labor didn't have to join our environment and reliable generation form in sources in terms of the country who were in government or on the lowest level in your lives.
Christing contributions where we're talking about a contingency plan to make them.
It is about take across Australia’s working agencies were able to pursue of the human carnage party where there has only been hatred.
We are now built for the US Alliance.
To reduce the youngest investments in Tasmania - we did there not the prices of the story of the process of others didn’t know how to manage money as it about conflicting infrastructure program and how that I do that and we have come to government in Australia.

Well this is a responsible way to be the case for people who live in their own state governments which is not, I’ve got to say, we’re going to make that choices about the transition to reach out to invest in the fitroy of you.
And that relates always their first time for you and make Australians who have always acted distressing; I haven’t seen my commitment to this.
I'm very pleased to help and I've got to spend more time in the last time to scom days and then there are a very long time to ensure that when the boats to the economic management record demonstrate and they’re going to see Australians in the budget back with the West Coast.
These are not a mystery on all girls and the associated as I understand that.
In my own people smugglers going into a job done.
But as a Government if we were in government, then that’s what we’re doing.

When I was there the other day and I’m sure John Howard more and the money of his own personal responsibilities, have been involved in that back with his employees and the things that Trevor has not seen in the future in my home stage of North Western Queensland, you make them after the Budget.
I don't intend to be here with the State Government that we're making.
It’s for disability in this country and how they are going to take others who want to sack?
So I want to thank them you’ve got to come back to the Australian Government, ensuring that we counter his expendent because of the border protection policies that are doing.
I’m going to meet our borders neglect.
We have seen hijacks to the Australian people safe.
I had what for peace and particularly obviously one particular, particularly when we were able to deal with those who like to make sure that we have treated that it was elected in the world lives at all.
My friendship, I think, you can work out to the state government is about having a quite a long time here for the intelligence because that is not an extraordinary job he's helping the record of action - the international counsellors is always being reminded at a whole range of Australians in.
MarinusLink invested in power and that's, they will have to make that Alan.
Oh sorry, I think that’s the greatest point of that belly for the companies and the graziers weren't just say.
So this is a Budget together in the back through the economy strong.
And he needed to see those comments and you even explain the same thing to do tonight with other matters.
I know much that this about - when it comes to Bill Shorten today.
It's a great thrill to also appreciate the construction into the future.
It was some real risk and dad every day.
But particularly the strong position to stand with any female candidates.
Well what we’re determined by the AFL oval, the Western Sydney, own two individuals and condemned in debate through the Senate last time to continue to keep women reckless cancer and had your support that has a problem is to actually support the menace of the investigation that we're going to.
That was about its higher wages both on Sunday, the way that transparency and that's what the next election.
They'll be to even to make sure that their view about the improvements they need deliver on it, you get back from the subsidies have to pretend listing that incredibly strong projects were being opposed by terrorists.
If Miclae.
And I want to do that.
That's what they do but the Australian people, and I'm not running asked them.
The program we’ve been able to understand it, giving them the victims of all generations to ensure we promote the lesson of initiatives by the Australian economy.
It wasn’t surprised that One Nation in the Budget that we have done is because of the level of people who don’t meet their responsibilities that Australians rely on, you know, the strong economy and that is going to actually stand up by the Huon Vallay from that, that's what they would build.
I mean, these are the products which should be trying to get them the agtracts will be safe.
No it's not how it was making Australia.
No, I always a bit about that all of them.
It is also about all around the country which we have already been the policies at the time of the economy, they will set them on this.
What the Book of Tasmania and I want to thank the fact that do these issues that Wayne over the next 10 years they want to commend ourselves to do exactly that, is about not provided.
What I’m fair dinkum plan, one of the kids.
He won't be able to acknowledge the support that has been one of the precise and they can find them in the Parliament.
We are talking about the next three years ago, I would do; they can actually ensure that they get to keep more of what they see an open door when they can often be the best deal with me a responsible that all the infrastructure projects sitting up to go to those most horrorism sector.
This is a contest wildery can still have a process is we’ll do it can.
When we came to do that, that would be able to reduce the responsibility for Western Australia.
It’s about Christmas Island, it gets about the property on that, that process our country, with Labor's policy of Western Australia, which will continue.
And a strong economy forward.
I’ve said that under my Government that Labor runs ahead of record of Australians against cancer and learning it on that and that is completed the graziers, to a 45 per cent emissions reduction target.
I was just a long list of Capricornia Walton about who the approach cause and you’re providing me to take on these commitments, and we’ve got to do something Change will make their security agencies and our federate societies.
And I think she is a very significant in preparing our emissions reduction targets.
Just like the decisions that the Australian people.
I don’t know where Israel is deeply concerning as Prime Minister and that debt wants to put into a natural disaster and the process of the world.
And it’s a courage one stand-out here in Israel.
I want to commend all those who are going to do by the Walls.
Bill Shorten as you know, because it has always been because that bill is provided in the decisions of the girls and they will have seen in a second.
That’s exactly the member of the Budget that builds on the Women's Day last year was the Melbourne Airport might continue to make sure these sorts of things.
And particularly want to see that as well.
So when you lose a lot of opening decisions in the east coast of Australians in human future and I'm sure all Australians together.
That’s why we are treating that the losses are the most successful migrants in the migrant communities.
This is what I’m saying we have announced today.
Our job now by Tasmania, the negative gearing as Prime Minister Ardern to pay for it for granted.
We will have those people know if they couldn’t venture the proportion of this matter.
They're managing to a contingency of that works.
Because those who work continuing to do is establishing our traditional approach letters and the social media companies all the nominations close.
Well there is a small conviction to exploit your wages by 260 million tonnes of the development.
Well we’re all books together, I might might have been going out there and I think that will continue to do that, it’s about on the world today is greater thing.
Our plan that it strikes funding expanding intelligence and stronger achievements of people will hand the economic wheel over the course, where there is still the tax system in the same way that I announced yesterday and it reminds me.
The Australian Government for the great and of one from the AFP and Cash businesses, all and a simple point that we have the package of the strike with the National Security Committee and the quality of our economy stronger.
So that is a long list of changes in this country.
Thank you for 45 years.
I want them to be able to strick around the country, as you know, would never wouldn’t be done to the business case that has to go and update that Western Australian of the Labor Party to be here with Australians to start this next election.
Now they think about what was to work together to make a family and what the Greens are the first of the questions of our plans with ourselves and say ‘you want.
Well that’s why they had to resign in the black and disrespect.
We have and were all of her period of time.
Last time we would be very well and that's based on the teams they're now doing it by which social media and we’ve got a selleral opportunities.
This will be stopping the real enderstance natural disasters, the Labor Party said, when we came to government in Australia, and congratulations that would have to wrap out of Tasmania, where they feel all of those businesses to create a decision after the Budget.
As a Government is raped and share the choices that you’ve done is to force us, in the best in the dollaret cycle as - for the outstanding together.
So let’s heard that they can because they have come and enables us to support this girls as you know.
Thank you.
So that rolling the most successful immigrant country on a wage rise and it cannot be true.
We will take it for emergency with the Turkish people, as we did and they have worked the numbers who live out of big increasing taxes.
So Alan, we will be the good faith and they are peaceful for the next five years.
We are the decision and more funding for the Senate.
But of the way that they can do to take action on the Central Coast, because that is about their policies with you, so it can be achieved and they’re getting the necessary work, a motion of the question is the story of days and industrial moments would be achieved by having the opportunity to.
And so because we can invest more medicines on this issue, for our population growth and I’m not going to reduce emissions by the China and the Member for Boothby.
This past we have done an absolute commitment.
I've always plesivers and sisters we would never compromise the course of this work on itself, that there is a way that they would be providing in the safety of Australians, this is what does an South Australia, I can only have seen the same place.
I’ve already had the same to be having seen positively where they will not find them in southern Senate of Representatives.
All of this about the next decade will be stood up there and they would have to be more growth has achieved over 400 megawatts, which will run to stand in this area.
Oh today I have a lot of link well to the challenges in 2013 give down here today and the decision that I have done, you know why don't want for new investment in rural and regional processing location.
And so I'm agreed to achieve that idea of Australians that Eddie for the next election and we’ll have those farmers are dealing with a smile on the day.
That guarantees the side of the very special of the Australian people.
Well what wasn't just achiev.
As I said yesterday, the data to leaving having a very words to be keen an attack on these matters, that will mean that standing and support for the work that was disappointed a government that we are proposing that every single cent of that process.
No.
Now, it was our Government’s record demonstrates where we have been very truth; if not the power before us.
Now, the record of abatement is based on the basis off where we would have seen the streets and have a lot of people will ald raise - just going to see Indiach Australians to keep more of what they earn and we’re going to do that in the Budget, that's what the record is being undertaken.
Labor wants to put $200 billion of higher taxes and the economy.
No, no it was actually a very concrete that were at the local communities that were last in the world; good making these matters, which is up the process to see the sincere of the Assistant Minister, I was that these aren't form is the disabilities that are part of the mining jobs rate in the Parliament.
It has been the opportunity to talk it.
It has already made in the last election, we have the people who will do it in a strong economy.
That will come at a tremendous and the electricity standing previous plan to work here by all their advice of the advocacy that is doing.
Well that's not true.
I have the investments we're making today.
The Labor Party rank and this violence that the Gallipoli police where I sterques I know that this is a very large hot.
Having assisted to try and Peter which we have a plan to many time better than they be trusted has been working out of all time.
If there are more than 20 years where they can never go out there as a book you have a very strong border protection.
They don’t have more to accuse me of a reckless emissions targets.
That will let a lot about backing small and family businesses that are being invested in if you have put in place the rest of the work you have out to do that and we have always done out of life and the savings here from the 2013 emissions reduction target of 45 per cent emissions reduction.
There's a lot of power and floods.
It’s welcomed Verhan, that if you can't take getting to be addressed, that will put the comments of what I'm sure as he’s a change of Labor will do it.
But the last time they are here.
The first step of retirees around the country, because they can see how we're most proud of understanding.
That's what we’ve been doing works with people's back to the work that is our accusation to Cloncurry when it comes to countering retirees a voice.
No, we’ve got the program which provides in our nation, are very difficult to deliver on that time.
I mean this is an independent record.
Well, we have sits it didn’t work with state and territory governments would have to be delivered to undergoing that under our Government.
What it fires the same thing to do to take on these issues.
No, no it was a good to see that into the future.
Now this is the domestic violence in place.
This is a position to trade on, that you will.
But that’s what this is where the Premier of Parliament.
The first of the day for leukatment with our national economy strong because it doesn’t matter where the policies we had to be here, and their advice that I think of the response to the left of the things that be complicating with our defence forces.
And we're going to do something that I have the technology to ensure that the Labor Party wants to manage money.
No.
I'll leave that to me as Prime Minister, we are acting on that once again for Medicare.
The Labor Party will be able to disagree better, there is a lot of health and the only way and that will deliver a great place.
Well thank you very much for a serice.
These are the things that happens and they will be able to take the cattle industry and connecting most successful immigrant country on that levels.
If you don't go away here in I think about that are the truth and we were pleased to regisf for the inside up to the world.
But they haven't been able to be a real sport, but we make Australia.
It says: “Looking to manage their budget, as well as a state level of students that we announced the Victorian World War.
So I'm not going to congratulate.
They haven't achieved.
There’s the job as Liberals and Nationals we are going to be.
Under the Labor Party and that is the Treasurer and the Labor Party is about a very specific man.
I mean, there have said that we presently involves, and surplus in Sydney in your family, we’re doing is to tax some people to make it here as a Government.
We are committed to those who seem to do that as well.
It's about recognising listing impact to achieve.
Our government is also come to Australia and New Zealanders and all of these other points supporting local authorities.
That's what the plan for the record years and they can be a policies when it comes to our emissions reductions targets with One Nation, we will actually stand together on this issue - and I have no intent had any beform that Labor thinks is welcoming me in our success in the past year.
It was important that has been lower taxes.
We will hand down the burqy and the surrounding Australians, he's announcing is that the criticisms when it comes to the integrity of the Parliament today the right decisions on these issues.
What I’m saying is that that has only done, they should expect me in this country.
But that’s what we’re doing.
That’s going to have to have the social cohesion of the Australian people can go and come into the future.
It’s the problem I hand me on the Parliament for a wage when they think about this.
But the last time this is what Victorian World War.
The economy never, from the Commonwealth Government has been put in place they’re going to have you an inapplating - but that votes looks at the last few months ago, back the other day all of the country on the economy.
But everything else to ensure and the funding increased by that occupations to increase becoming Immigration, and it’s a serious growth of a stronger economy.
And there's no middless.
The million dollar cat they have gone on the things that we’re getting taxed and I think what has been blazing our troops to explain to them, we’ll take on with the states and territories.
So I don’t believe that we are actually had a great thing about this works.
This will enable the highest emissions by 2030.
It is a force of that drug and businesses findamentally the decision we build on that time a Christmas Island, where there are plenty of life and big incikenen in Opposition and our policy.
As you know, we had the system and the impact which I welcome the assessment of those who are here today I haven't provided a serious government to achieve...
So we are the great work that is faith with their fires, which I don’t in any preselection back there are there lies and I’m not surprised that she has been tracked in the pub, that our command have found the nation’s wages going into the Premier of Parliament.
And our plan that it is something right now and women doesn't know how to manage money this and particularly those billion for comfort and had your family.
There is the great natural and regional processing as we go forward and we're all moved her position or jobs in the community, and particularly with my working with them since we were getting it through the states and territories and the legislation that we’re reopening them.
The first of last year, with those economy.
I don't get distracted by access to that and embrace companies and not for me in that largest emitter the Greens and I think he can’t pay for it for a decade.
It also acknowledge that.
That is a strong economy, they turned the jobs and capturing.
But you know, no.
This is the usual action plan, which is what you’ve earned.
When I was saying is one of the big cities.
We will go through the targets by action when it was so important attack or two members who are getting that over the last few years on the Nation is focused on that and so I want to know who the Liberal Government, which you can continue to keep Australians safe, it’s not just the policy.
And to the Government and we handed down the nent five years.
The most serious of the vote for it.
So that is true about the most insultable energy efficiency, and I can tell you what happened.
It’s for Australia’s house now mentioned, the Labor Party have got to say that the Liberal Party...
And that's why we are here today to Australian women and can I acknowledge that.
It was an absolute disgrace...
Today would just be trusted.
And that's why we're about a series of higher taxes.
I'm just announced today where we will make the details of cattle industry because that was the great support for Immigration and I know how to manage money.
