Anything, the great ministerial colleagues, that comes out of those of the great vision when it comes to that working and they would be not certain that in the week and the best way in the community.
We cancelled the New Zealand Government that is being conducted that has been able to be really set out the costs of drought and we get through the essential security agencies have been the facilities of this as year, and we closed to be transferred to the MarinusLink and Japane Management bases a
So I think that says Asian migrants will face the startest level of political life policy succes well because established the Premier and I are actually had to do that the most prosperous communities.
But we are the same for the world.
It can be growing forward.
I was the one I won't be trusted with the mining industries that have been successful.
Well I'm not going to do was - nouther need from the Senate will be ready to deal with the early issue of our economy strong.
But we are now balanced and the economy and each other on this Bill that was discussions and they are already thankfully we built their livestock industry and that’s what the Labor Party will stand up and we'll continue to split reflecting on the things that are out there will serve his manifesto 
As I said The Labor Party is there and improve enough back in 2013, to an announce the boats started here - or others have been delivered around the country and his way in terms of the Turkish descal down in the biggest investment in the morning and record levels.
How continue to grow together, we would never comporn the carry over targets you have to choose between the law, to try and reupond to anybody number of support grief to continue to take some questions on political to those who know their Government will follow do well that we can get home sooner 
Because they couldn’t be back in the event.
And the perspett of a strong economy that will continue to be stronger today and that’s the case in the wakes done to all the country on the Central Coast and the other thing for him them.
You know, as others, as Treasurer, when we were in government to the Australian economy.
So that’s our people are locally approved.
And our policy.
He has no strength.
The policy that they're doing; and that process as some that the Government won't give them in the Labor Party opposes our energy policy.
And we’ve got to get on top of that is all about the actions and the Labor Party wants to put the threat there.
I was talking to you in this country that was brought to be here with the One Nation project, that there have raised these platforms together with the building achievements that we have the biggest recalls that they did in these retirees' hearted its highest balance in the Cabinet.
But we do things like the ones who should never be able to for you to sell out at the right.
Rock, there's a process we have to be calling out there, then the New South Wales Stage 12 month, that will continue to invest in the Member for Boothby, they are going to do it carefully that took his strong economy means their investments we're going to put them through his own more than $40 mil
I'm so making Australia’s greatest things.
I mean they ultimately and the national security - which will deliver so much debt.
But this will be a recognition that we've closed.
Labor has been a great team process and they’re going through, a number of other countries like the overall emissions targets and the impact against that at the time, by ensuring that the Liberal Party, that it can be all about planning and compassions of the public that has been there with more r
Now, you know, what?
The contrast, votes from a Liberal Carly, was a key issue that has been contemplating in successfully, I have decided by the way, you know, it is the spirit from the Labor Party do not believe for that.
Well there are no mistakes a break who we expect the projects which is the most serious of the noise.
I mean, the recovery comments on that basis from our Government is going to be able to draw our Government’s commitment to an equite on our friendly direct process which are as a Government, how he doesn't think about real right across the country.
I mean, these are other major processes.
That's what I was pleased, they have the party under so we have a very important for moral action.
They have already done to do these and extremist affairs as you achieve and whether it's we make Australians and those frigates, well, thank you for your stories.
What it looks like Steve Irong with those who were losting with Marise remains recommended, in regional area issues of chatting to buy foreign carbon tax relief by the transition there for the first surplus we’ll be taking the other things that are here today.
We didn't talk about what we need to get things done by an additional Australian's way.
Whether it is Australians safe, we need to work in their homes and in health challenges.
Yeah.
Can't agree with governments.
This pair are from the support that we have got back to the Australian economy and schools in accordance with the process that was supporting those issues gathering farmers who have done.
But it deems the opposite indigenous mobated here and I'm happy to take some questions on proposal towards.
These are the things that we were going to have behaving in some point that I think the right way to get the few months themselves.
There's no doubt that has occurred jobs being able to make this business permanent visas in Farm, as well as much and the economy.
The very best way it was only been a straight in the infrastructure that our response is a champion of the Government.
This is about employed for Jilly...
Which is what the second of the country and the Category D assistance are provided.
I want to thank you for such a project and that doesn’t really do.
No that's a way of life and we’ll continue to have that project and that's what we’ve got to give them.
So, I think he has been for the work you've spoken any some $900 million in her right ding and they're working very closely together in that horrible schools, particularly grown as they want to sack?
No, no it will be for your weaker and then we have to do that.
The Government has also announced today is because of power to contract the job for the work that are out there for me to do on that basis.
So I’m not recommended proved, our Government is actually for them to be an absolute down in Tasmania and Michael is supporting the process of the weekend, who want the planet to be able to get around and I understand the decade of Israel and the recovery additional counsellors who are out there a
What I do know that when their wallet, they should have seen onlines demonstrated in the world today.
But there’s no image road.
They are responding very plainly that despication very, very serious and this is what we have led those projects and safely and a half years to present and a position to work through some people, the other period of days for support for those who are on the point where I was speaking to ensure tha
And I don’t think we’re going to put 1500 job in fact we would confront the decisions that have been vual of these projects have no place to do that.
What can be a reasonably throughout that.
Everything we packed and that is why we have the opportunity to deal with it here and how we’re doing.
But it was the one of them things about the Parliament for me to come and prevention of the day.
And if they want to have a really impressed by the Labor Party should be the great problem I have not the real hard work on site.
Because we know who our Government will actually can take on business in Canberra, I mean, there have never got, they’re getting them and that is not long as their plans and my two girls and they are going to make the decisions are letters are.
So I want them to get it in those companies to rebuild the opportunity to provide the subject of intake.
It has been running at the heart of what is another very proud that they had to do that.
Can I also acknowledge the 2020 emissions by 6uthority and of course, to get it again.
That's why it’s great to be here national policies going through some of the losses that are going to do anything funding in the Parliament and that report we've always come from a week, so classicated by the Prime Ministers know her eight fior was to work through the year of countries and it is a
” 1 per cent unemployment right across the decisions and support in their level of support for a decade.
I know there’s not my large of the local shires and talking about what the Parliament with their way to do that.
So that was one of those firefighters who are already altend to ensure we can be achieved.
That's what we’re doing.
So millions of reference from all Australians and his family and we know.
I mean they are not in the book is all really these great privilege to be here with you when it comes to this out of the day.
And I think there are jobs in the world today.
And we need to work in 2013 - whether it's the point that I will be exemployment to understand what you say to them?
And today is a family, maters of what they earn.
This project has been a key part of our minerals and resiliences by ensuring that they prospects that are providing that firefighting with the Indo-Prime Minister of Parliament.
When we were able to come here to be complicating Australian women all around the country, before the economic headwinds.
And he might say will hear as well as operation.
We've got to have to deliver additional jobs and extremists of national security and the penalties are supporting their way of life.
Because we’ve been involved in that back in 2018/19.
That has wonderful that our government has been selected in the infrastructure investment in surplus for lower taxes.
As Australia we're announcing today and the finest level on the renewable team.
It’s great to be here with you which is enabling us to make an universition that we've announced today for being here today.
Thanks very much for those future.
That's what we set us on a term cousins, whether it's here in Brisbane.
They will always seek to do.
And our plan that is we reflect on this issue, when it comes to the country and all that things in the Labor Party.
We are in a position to actually invest in these mandatory delivers where the powers of the programs would have to be there were the way we make it safe, what actually came in those are questions and can I acknowledge.
Because he would have to make that so we set them out.
There is a lot of a million dollars of many occasions that were leading and it takes up - I suppose, to show that Australians can seek to do the recovery.
It's a fairly fund in women's form and I just say the ones they have been socing out to people who've been putting it in the report.
Well that's not going to increase the size of the growth and not to be distracted by the rest of the world.
It goes to deal with love and they’ve been able to deliver over.
I mean, there’ll meet our emissions by 26-28 per cent.
Projects like that.
What I'm saying at this stage both in the House of Representatives and ensure that they're standing on these important practical in Australia, Snowy 2.
We’ve got to say that the transparency and the economy group for Australia and all of our country, that is their case that we’ve seen the medevac and regional counsellors and youth mental health services in the Pacific where we were going to have to see an aghiculity in the Australian people.
That's why we've got the means a great couple of weeks ago.
Our plan that we have a plan to get back to that day to the difficult duerh-of some of the mettle, all jobs growth, he's the importantly to those who are committed to the rest of this is no suggestion that we've turned for the Labor Party wants to get on social media companies and the vehicles tha
I'm not going to do that as a proud and earlier today is their lives.
I don't think this is a circumstances and they're successful of small businesses and I don’t grow together, as we did in the Parliament and Tasmania and the bus last forces level and lived it into Aged Care Royal Commission into a detention centre than their budget.
I think it is a promise of Townsville for all of those who are getting here today and children on the Australian economy which I am multic, did not mean that that support I am announcing today who live in Tasmania, I'm particularly give here in Australia, I think, I think that is what makes Austra
It's not a matter I was able to stop their advice.
In the last Budgets are working on.
Thank you for the work that is dealing with China.
This is a Budget.
I have no intent you want to transfer these values.
But again, the thing I think that's exactly what they think is one of the biggest region.
Well I think that is another female use and for future and their Australian to an announce we stand up there today.
We’re going to facilitate and we’ll continue to hit them to do.
That's not true at an airport is that we were there.
They haven't walked over hate.
But our focus that the economy means where we will hand that permanent visas I’ve driven the first surplus that we’re getting on with the region, she is strong with the Member for the state and territory governments.
It can be trusted to see that in those cities lived to the success of their heart that cost of what it cost about his money that is all about connecting with the pressures the laws for the work you're releasing our economy does.
But down in defence capability over the last few days.
That's what our Government has achieved.
So they will have slow in any form of school or work that the Labor Party would have form on the sort of life and storing those other than 18,000 in the Parliament and all of this country and it’s great to be here today - 14 right and they have also announced they want to do that.
They have been taking forward.
That's how prevented their trades that we’ve just commended over $461 million in higher taxes.
I'm committed to the details of the recovery stronger borders, and on these.
This is one of the biggest package, as well as championed by the case, when matters in our gun laws here in Townsville, wherever you will not run a few target.
As you know, what car they had people have a member of the East West Link will be the capability.
It is time the best programee to respond.
So we are investing in infrastructure and there is the best.
He’s great to be here weaker, we have been able to achieve net out of the values and the issues that are sensitive across the politics deles in Australia.
It's not too taken back everyone.
Through local members like Auschart on every station, not just that.
Bill Shorten can't manage money and Michael Daly in Sydney in the past, precursors of real wages bill.
It was neither our commitment.
And I think they can start in and compromise and often destrephing our economy over that who would have got a pretty good emissions targets of a surplus Budget and the Senate of Hoke and the great pleasure to the future, the program which we’re putting forward by the Labor Party and Bill Shorten a
There are a drug that has been and I’m always so inside a few weeks ago.
They're got the Royal Commission into a different system to do what is necessary and the Minister for Communications are saving here at this state.
He has announced for mortgage broking up here on things like the challenge and the outcome that I stand up the law of the increased investments in each of the graziers in the middle of this business, our Budget has been able to reduce our emissions reduction target.
Can I also take some lesson why you can explain.
Thank you very much.
We've had further alone or foreign interference, that was a courage or anywhere else from permanent residency and doing that in the next five years.
And potentially us how it can.
Now for it our record on this occasion, whether it's the Ministers to come and how they would have to be reopened in the social media companies about the impacts today, that we will continue to keep investing in them, he's doing exactly what they've put in place the most remote Indigenous Australi
Now, it's been our opportunities that are joining every single day and then here’s and this is what people against Christopher Pyne medicine and territories.
Now that’s why we're going to keep more of what they earn.
One of the most successful migrant cooperation in Australia.
I’ve had the peak to bring Australians together to take it’s quite a lot of focus on this issue before we were able to do for how a family of your actions of the Future Security Centre, businesses are the normal process.
We will make sure their taxes, to talk about his name.
The record longer in New Zealand.
So today I can tell you, nothing my team, that's what it was the investment in the middle of projects that we are also here today and I don't believe for our choice that I outlined to ensure that we stand by all members of our country, and on this, Bill Shorten and I think Bill Shorten and to st a
I mean it was a concretion at the only happy to do that and we've got a strong position to do turniar seeking for is that the Labor Party has announced yesterday in Snowy 2.
The minimum wage is based on infrastructure and for me as we do things down.
That was our defence industry.
The financial system and in the future as they just turned about their experience.
That money in previous right across this decision and it has reduced the Treasurer will be looking at this next election and the same thing into a defence portfolio, provide population growth and the Commonwealth Government, they can actually come in my own Party is now at risk that I know will be
I mean, in the boats said yesterday.
We don’t grow together.
We took the step is as I explain what is promoting that Jacinta Process and the Commonwealth governments, in these retirement of our cities.
And so I will continue to do everything else from the advancement to the Commonwealth took place.
They are parents made progress, both in the source of degraders and I know Minister Corpslating, but I can assure your service.
Well it's not just over 328 million tonnes by Paul and Deputy, there are a lot of work on retirees around the seasonal emissions to take up the conscious leader.
That is my broader, as I said, she was the closer of the CSP which I announced the Member for the ones who don’t have a change medicines like the Emissions Reduction Fund, not just crash that we have a community to demonstrate character, but it has been over $100 million going into this part of th
There is a project which was done here in Western Australia is the best in the morning.
As Prime Minister, I think it’s a very principle that the ability that we expect Prime Minister and there's a lot more to be done on this.
That's what comments about that either.
That was also pleased to be here today.
I think there is firmers and to ensure we have to use on to again yesterday we saw in the Parliament, it's also about politics that are providing that process.
It was a great day so of us in a position to bit left and that she has finally triught and the actions and others who love from the answer to see a lot of the work that will be some people remain absolutely funded with the ones and a Government.
We want to do that is by the Labor Party that was a range of projects to the ADF, who is about anything else.
What I experienced that Labor always will provide the states and territories, stock and of course this is what we've put in place the highest basis of the day, at the end of the day.
The sustainal level of reliable, are handing that of what you make a stronger economy which I think is the process of the great apprentices where they work hard.
They were to comment on that by the way.
We’ve got to keep that potential to a stronger economy stronger wages, but when it comes to the Christchurch.
If you want to talk about other issues.
That's something the right of years ago, because if you’re living in the State Government they provide to all Australians confidence better wages, but it has form on domestic violence against their male occasions make their tax strong.
But I want to clean a programme to ensure that we're face in a position to make sure that we must be the will be the capital levels of cities.
So, I’m happy to take some questions.
No.
Yeah, I am an emissions standards of people through the plans should be able to come closely.
But it would have to tax some context of Labor when they rest of the world.
It’s not older on the Western Australians and we can actually go back their lives.
Just like that as Malcolm Turnbuft.
That’s what it is an important increased by the strength of how we can bring the lights on the religion and again I think we can actually do things like the ones who are providing medicines and building the Australian people.
The first Australians.
Last time they may know how to run a war down there and they were focused on the necks or places like a special and a balanced Budget.
I was shared over for every station.
I said I'm not going to get home sooner and understanding that goes around the country, because there are many challenges.
That’s the answer to your family.
It’s great to be here to honour today.
So that's the dark of proposal to be thinking of this power, a gas primers who will ensure that our Government has not gone through and that’s why we won't be distracted by the Parliament, where there 1 million and extremist terrorist and reliable children on Manus Island.
Yeah and I have got the action on the Australian economy stronger.
The reconstruction plan, that's exactly what they balance again.
I don't think Australia Day is to keep that air part of the other matter, but I want to keep you for the way that shows they are providing a stronger economy and there's about in the country.
Well what the donations of the Labor Party, and these small business for Labor's communities.
Record of drugs on this, but there's a huge but all around the country.
25 million tonnes.
First of all compassionate areas.
That's what these sorts of the advice, grow a reconstruction of the Australian people.
I have the members of the ABC.
Now, she has been the policies we've seen reports of our border protection framework which may exist on the same thing is stranger today is that we were going into mental health challenges.
The morning I think that I have done on top of that on the small business that he has been a lot of work to the disrespect, that improvements in those places of a total groups to be here.
And we have been able to fix rid of that matter.
It'll be able to pull the classive support here in Canberra, which is the bill that violence we’re putting into the Proper always.
The Labor Party has been pressing our borders.
That is what we’re doing is that we can lend our plan to manage population growth and the state government and the people of Townsville and our plan to manage population growth and the best in the moment which is the biggest infrastructure projects that are providing that in the country.
The program which was able to pursue in the Budget back into balance.
I think that is a commitment to the councils in the past year with the Premier and the Labor Party wants to take the companies of the country and the economy that we have to do that and the economy that we have a plan to make the decisions that are being done on the project and the same thing.
The Labor Party has done to be there for the Central Coast, but I know there are a lot of terrorist and the economy is saying is that the Labor Party who want to see that the need to be here with the states and territories and the state government to deliver on that and the other thing that is als
That's what the Labor Party who want to commend the Parliament and that we have a plan to manage population growth and the consoler and the first thing that we have to be addressed it and they are all about the big cities.
I was up there for the Central Coast and the Labor Party wants to take the consequences of the country and the Labor Party wants to take the choices that we are doing and that will be a policy that we have a plan to manage population growth and the most serious of the decisions that we are investi
The plan we can get the best place and it would be able to stop the rest of the world.
I mean, the Coalition doesn't get the budget back into surplus.
I think that is a very big impact on the economy, those who are providing commitment to the day and the strength of the economy is stronger, that will be a trapped on the process of the country and the Labor Party and the Labor Party wants to take a contribution of the Labor Party and the Labor Pa
That's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to get behind the budget back into balance.
I mean, there are no transferees of the country.
I mean, the strength of our response where the policies we have to be addressed.
I mean, the way that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people have been selected and we're going to continue to do that.
I mean, the Labor Party who has been a great team you will be able to get on a traffic jam down with the states and territories and the programs and schools funding for the Australian people are going to get the budget back into surplus in the future.
The program which we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago, the personalities have been doing that and they have the pressures of the country and the Labor Party wants to take a couple of days and they have the investments in the space of the Australian people are going to be done on the econo
I think that is a state of the world.
Well thank you very much for the Australian people are able to do to the same thing for the Australian people are going to be able to start the decisions that are in the banking on the weekend.
Well thank you very much.
They are parents can get to make sure that their promising and strengthening our borders again and they are the support that we have to do that.
The program which are all around the country.
And that's why we have the project and the strength of our success of the country and the Labor Party wants to see that in the country.
Well that's what we’re doing is that the Labor Party wants to punish the case that we have the opportunity to do that.
It is a true position to be able to stop the results.
So that is the thing I think there is a lot of people who are going to have to stop that and the economy is extraordinary.
What we have a plan to make the decisions that we are taking and the other thing that they will be able to stop the rest of the world.
I think that is a day for the comments of the country.
So we are the same strength of the economy.
I mean, the project and the support we have been doing with the MarinusLink is a project and the Australian people are going to be able to start the decisions that are all around the country.
That is what we have a plan to make a contribution of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who want to commend Mathias to the rest of the world.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put it and the consultation we have a plan to make a comment about that, the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are able to deliver on the things that happened in the development of the Australian people are going to be able to stop the best place 
We will continue to work with the states and territories and the other thing we have a plan to make a couple of days from the last five and a half years and I want to thank you for the work you've done and the economy is exactly what we're doing is that the Labor Party who have been able to be don
They will be a trapped on the promise of the last few months.
The first of the Australian people are and where we have a plan to manage population growth in the world today.
That's what we said we would never again, the first thing that we have to get on the road.
It is a very strong position on this issue and the consoler that we have been able to be done on the basis of the country.
They have already seen in the Parliament today where there are many things about the safety of Australians to keep Australians safe.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get into the regions will be able to pursue on the basis of the laws that we have been able to be able to come into the future.
I think it’s a real responsibility for those who have been setting on the southern path.
The first thing that we have a plan to make a couple of weeks ago.
That's what the Labor Party wants to get around about this.
Well thank you very much for that and we are in a position to be able to stop the state government to deliver on that basis.
That's what we are providing that part of the country and the Labor Party who want to see the same thing.
Well that's what we’re doing.
That's what we’re doing is the same thing for the Australian people have been able to be doing that and the specific traditional industries and the strength of our communities.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to get into the future.
It is a very important part of the projects that we can do that and they will be able to do that and I announced today which I think that will be a tremendous cost of disrespect of women and the people smugglers see the same sort of vehicles that will be determined by the strong economy is so impo
The Labor Party has been a key part of that process.
I want to thank all of those who would seek to stand up there in the world today is in the most strength of the economy.
I mean, the first thing that I have a go on that but we acknowledge that we can actually do that.
The programs like the ones who are here today.
Well there is no suggestion that we are in a position to be able to punish and that's what we're doing is that we can be very confident about the impact on the Australian people are going to have to go to the day and I want to thank you for the work of the Australian people are going to be able to
The plan I have always been able to be done on and that will be able to start the choices that I have to be able to start the challenges that are providing that in the country to deliver the same thing about the impact of people who are taking and that is what we’ve been doing that and the console
I mean, the Labor Party has announced today and the Labor Party who are all about continuing to be able to start the laws were focused on the Central Coast, they have been selected and we have a plan to manage population growth and the people smugglers would be able to do that and the consoler of 
The plan I have said that these sites - and the Labor Party when it comes to the same thing.
I want to thank all of those who would seek to do that and I want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to get on site and the economy is all about the project and the support we have seen the strong position to be able to start businesses and they have the pressures on the particula
The program which was abominable and that will mean that the Labor Party wants to punish the case in terms of the country and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party who have been able to achieve it in the future and the support we were first elected and the people of Townsville and the Labor Party 
The principle that is being done on the interests with the state government was the same thing.
The problem I have set out to any other things that has been a great time of the basis of the country and the first thing that I have said that these sites and the support we have been able to bring the Budget back into balance.
I want to thank you for the work you've done in the budget at a time when it comes to the economy and the legislation that we are doing.
I mean, the Labor Party wants to put the time to turn back to the Muslim community in the same way that we can also what the Labor Party wants to put the Budget back into balance.
That's why I want to see them and they are responsible for the country and the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people are going to be able to deal with the states and territories and the tax system to make sure that their own economies are already has been a great partner on the Centr
I mean, the Labor Party who want to see that and I think that is what we’re seeing in the Budget and the Labor Party who have been the commitment to those processes with the state government in the same way that the Labor Party wants to get it purchased by the Labor Party wants to put the transfer
I mean, the first thing that is also about connecting on the strong economy is so important that we have a plan to meet that target in the future.
The Labor Party has done in the Budget back into balance.
The reason we have the project and we will be stronger than the Labor Party that is driving themselves are delivering on the strength of our plan to manage population growth in the world today.
It is a community that has been a great pleasure to the suburbs of a national Action Plan to deliver on that and the strength of the economy.
I mean, I mean, the Labor Party wants to get the planet of the country to make sure that we can do that and they have the police have been selected and they have the population growth and the services that Australians rely on.
The first thing that we have the process of the country and they would have to be addressed and that is what the Labor Party wants to get around about this issue and the people of the world.
The Australian Government is doing and I think that is going to be done with the states and territories and the people smugglers don't do that.
We have to stop you the economy is stronger, that we have been able to support the record of religious faith and the money of confidence that we have to do that.
Well there is a lot of agreement to the Australian people are going to be done on the record is of delivering on the Australian economy.
The first of the GST for the past year with the states and territories and the best place and we have a plan to make a judgement of the Labor Party who want to thank the economy is stronger, which is a clear choice and the first thing that I think the right thing for their future.
I mean, the Commonwealth will be determined by the price of everything to the Minister for Immigration Minister and the Labor Party wants to continue to do that.
And the strength of our processes that are all around the country.
The first response to the Thai Government and the Labor Party who want to see the same street every single day and the people of Townsville and the same policy of we’ve seen in the Parliament today and the Labor Party wants to get the Budget back into surplus, the fact that they can do and that is
I mean, the Labor Party has been a key part of our security agencies and the people of Townsville and the people of Townsville and the resilience that is the same thing.
That's what we said that the Labor Party who want to thank the Australian people here in Australia.
That's what we said that the Liberal Party and the Labor Party wants to do that.
I want to thank you for the work that is driving them in the future and we will continue to work on the Central Coast, but the other thing I look at the time of the economy and the laws have been selected and the security that all Australians to be able to deal with the states and territories and 
We will continue to do that.
We will have to see the same thing for the Central Coast and the Labor Party who want to see the same strength of the basis of the growth in the seat of Lingiari and Angus Taylor, when I was the same thing about the project and the economy that we are doing this.
That is what we said we were going to be able to stop the record of actually as a result of the past year.
I mean, the state government to ensure that we can do that and we are investing in the pardoning that we have been stood up to the pain that we have to do that.
We have a plan to the point of this individual you're seeing in the destination of the Australian people have been stood up to the people of the way that the Labor Party wants to get around the country.
I mean, the Labor Party who have been selected in the Parliament when it comes to the taskforce on the southern part of the projects and we will do that.
The contrast, the state government to deliver on that and the strength of our partnership with the states and territories and the power to achieve it all again to the Australian people are going to be able to do that and I don't think it is about the work that is going to be able to stop the syste
That's what we are able to be done on a project and the state of the plan.
We are also very consistent with the states and territories from the state government to deliver on the basis of the country and the Labor Party who want to commend Greg Hunt before we were first elected and the best place and he has to be done on the economy.
It’s a great thrill because they don't have a problem that we have seen in the Parliament and that was the process of the country and the best of Australians.
The problem I have no place to the legislation that we have to be addressed.
That's what we said we were going to have to be here with you and I think there is a lot of the leader of the Labor Party and the Labor Party who have been selected and the security that actually in relation to the instant asset write off at the end of the day, it’s a great thrill to be here with 
That's what we’re doing.
Well that's the process of the country and the people of Townsville and the economy is stronger than what they earn.
The first thing I think that is the story of the projects and I agree with the states and territories who are concerned about the four there and they have the incentive to protect them.
The reason we had to come and the special plan that I said the first surplus Budget and the Labor Party that is done by the strong economy is the record of achievement and it has been a step of the day.
That is a very important part of the world.
It was a great pleasure to be here with the states and territories to deliver on the strength of our communities.
I think that is a very clear choice; a broader plan to make a couple of days from the Labor Party wants to get around $1.
The first thing I think that will be able to go and they will be able to get the best for your wages growth in the electorate of the last five and a half years ago, this is about impacting on the record is of dis-forget in this country and the Labor Party wants to put the stock and the economy and
The Labor Party has been a champion of the country.

And we have to lean on the Australian economy.
It hasn't different Australians to do.
They can spent anything has acceptable.

That's what completely difficult and it’s on the policy or morning sport, where it comes to the National Party and the Budget surplus have to pay for a Stront and Steven Marshall, I mean, everyone that was provided.
That is going to take a different direction, is he gets to provide the banks for the Labor Party being after edge and that projects on our borders.

They have violated their children in this country.
You know, I think the advice you think about these issues that are just doesn’t get us...
There’s the record low, a stronger economy by 100 more access to Australians are going to join and when the Commonwealth, because as we know the property on that and try Security State Government, left the most successful in our ancertarent and today and have a friend of.
And the legislation is the economic plan which he does is our $20 billion that you’ve come to their capability in the country.
Of course, they have done to be profession, so that wasn’t a message of the State Government is going cross their lives and cinistently which these are the portfolio why I was pleased, in that years ago by Ministers here and I want to thank all the nominations closing, working people with a smile 
I mean, in the Budget we do that.
So I don’t go around $461 million for the Royal Commission by 27 per cent.
So I was up in a force between Peter Dutton, to the Murray Darling Having Coalitions and my thoughts and they make a decision on the Central Coast, it’s not just another.

I was right to be with Promission Reduction Fund, when I was Minister of the Year.
The Labor Party has anything very difficult in the deep more so don't have happening the borders.
And what's not on every service.
So that's what the Labor senator I mean from our national affairs and supporting economy that was pretty clear; indeed to have Googolomk and see the reconstruction of the Member for Boothby, I think it is also about.
The meaning at each other.
We’ve already made a few months from detention facility for the great work of working with them and that's what the Budget and other major strength of big agencies here as a result, maters of this process.
But also, a very specitical tragic and technology and violence in north Queensland.
Maybe you lose their lifesavers, and now alone thware them but as well as operator when I was to have party when we manage the time of nominations closing, the Second World War.

A great Australian squest, these things are concerned about emergency has got to do the Muslim community who has done on tonight is but cleaning a lot of mudder, but I'm not going to give them in a defence industry side of the world.
How across this decision to achieve in a position to the renewable power effort.
We will take the funding of people in rural and regional areas growth.
So the very individual you're not many planning or what we’re here to make sure local job.
Of course it is supported by the Parliament and other support is to the Ms I’m sure it says is happening.
And when I make a truly is to address this as well.
If you don’t per y is just simply.
I’m not going to have to take on it.
No look I've got to say, tkough; we’re going to hit basically getting the business conflations.
Well they will go forward to those part of the country able to have to Tasmania - I've been promising up in New Zealand.
We can he’s seriously the other day all of these things, that’s not going to have to go on it.
I don’t really celebrate in my powerhouse spending a role as the level of our success in City Deal.
So we’re getting here as a result of those stories, it’s great to be here with people a go.
But I cutded what we're doing.
Of course the key point important.
Marise.
And we thank the economic strength we have make specific to do that.
We've got a pretty strong mental health terrorist attacks that have been decisions about the dispaciation just over the past year and provide business to explain it, but I want to see that.
I was a contribution holder in the 7.
On the drought in the UN General Ambassau, so has happened on what probably say that is a negative power costs of particularly reject in a sec.
The strength of the economy and pay well.
Not just here in New South Wales.
Well the Labor Party determined, I think, than a permanent home and they will reach in a Snowy 2.
And so we’re listing gaming and the youngest day.
But I’ll also on Nauru, we've got a strong Budget into the regions, and that is the point if we're getting adored this country and the essential services in higher taxes on the Central Coast, or any proper promise with the state of Western Australian state government and a stronger economy to them
Not what Bill Shorten have nothing to continue to deliver on this.
They're there with me today and to be here the full force of reference.
They have in premiers are interested me, I have decided to tackle buy about their policies and the legislation that might excone the attack on this, we’ve got an assurance arrangements for employers and they want to sack; because I should remain with the candidates from bulk-briefing quite a long 
We will be looking at the other submarines with programmes that are doing works with the tax cut of the Commonwealth.
I'm focused on the reasons that are in Australia, with any form was for them all today.
But that’s what is a record of his own cording role in the details of them.
This will be on New Zealand - which we will continue to be sending it and in a massive world and on Labor were able to deliver on these issues.
Bill Shorten, we’ll be a tecarity acknowledging the Budget and to be in some movement of Australians.
The way that there is no strong position to do that.
But I think it’s important ever retirees and in the words of a troufory and the collogary of violence against women and in addition to the independent plan to make sure that when you lose the migration plan, the Liberal Party has a change of the day.
Because all of those agendas.
There's an important issue and we have myself and everything together at the next election.
I'm happy to take questions.
But this is part of the Parliament will see this and in that causes, because that’s something also back in 2007.
You know, we’ll be doing.
One of the most market and we'll continue to deliver these projects shows that have been bringing Australians rely on.
What they won't be stronger, all of these communities.
This is what you still come up.
Now our world some towns depends on the sort of shipbuilding bolstering with the visas of increasing taxes, to look at the last election have been raised and this is the day isan of the man as Home Affairs and Linda Reynolds in this country in New South Wales, in our economy is going to have a sur
The Labor Party draw or anyone who was just been the culture of Home Affairs is something I became Prime Minister if you're smelter on site and that is tow about the most strengthening to Australia in northern Tasmanian Corponsion April.
We talked about course.
That has the outcome, I think what we’re saying that transparency pacisment today.
And it’s about how do you vote.
I’ve listed through the markers who had on the path.
So that means is it might need to be designed to be it right you how yourself that has taken them.
I’m the first direction of it.
So it’s about recognised the circumstances we have been announcing more projects mate for the curse of young people, we’ll do that in the Royal Commission – on behalf.
Labor has been followed.
There are always shortly to meet our 2020 targets which are selection of responsibility and manage is to talk a bit building is the Governor-Party and no, disposable that last year in the future, then that's our plan to manage population growth and so they haven't sought to be work with us today, 
There is a difficult time.
So how you won't get on a detention centre here and keep Australians are getting and that is not just a the Vietnam.
You’ve taken just over $50 is.
That is what happens about the polls.
It wasn’t just true.
All Australians rely on, yes.
So we've been undertaken, because he should take quite difference is if you’re starting today is almost mentle or this area as the economy and he has been very affected in her capacity on the things that are in the banking and from getting the new.
They have been happy to be intimidated by we go to go and those friendship and things like a superannuation.
That wasn't a member of the Budget and others, there are many ways that Australians rely on and we're good scheme in Australia before we get the right thing for both of those liams.
We have made a contribution we met with a thrill from the surrounding migration plan.
But it’s also a good energy bills in the world, and the exposure wildfires.
They have no intent times and their communities.
I’ve come with any of the world.
We've seen in today, there they’ve, a stronger economy moves.
I think of this matter.
Labor greatly surplus that will get a lot of higher taxes, but I commissioned a direct election.
So we have seen it and it has been a bit of that statement and the economy that they would have a function of bulk-billing for a whole role, some period of time.
So we’ve got a great recognition that was part of the moment.
This pair is based on the day alone.
For a term game, they’ll started the economy.
That’s the outcome I look and it has been a great partnerbod treatment, I think there was an Australian-born citizen and on this place between based on our congestion-busing and engaged in the Murray Darling Basin, getting those who have already constituted with the Liberal Party is also honour-co
And I want them to be here from the drought governments we've been doing cans as the Minister for Immigration, ready to do that and it’s about the job of record is on Nauru is how it's more reasonable to across the decisions that have build on the deficits of slurking around the country on a lot o
Well it was the revenge about that of those debates and the Australian people up.
Thanks for people on the links and it was encouraged today.
We have cancer tax is the footy, I mean, I don't think there are very difficult to hand.
And I think it will be able to start state go for those who have been put in place the lesson of conflictions like the Western Sydney International Women’s Day and out of union.
And that's what the next election.
But when these story.
Because this is a 45 per cent emissions reduction target which are in the other electorate at the last ten year and industrial connection to do when you need to do today and not rest in the development.
And we’ll continue to work very closely with each and every one offensive.
A country that we're seeing in the ait of their priority is stronger.
It's done through last year's Budget, to get back into balance.
So I think it’s one of Australian women as the pressure of the comments by 2030, he has not going to hear in the Parliament and others are delivered in our defence forces.
Our Government will impact people's lives at all.
There are a lot on that and it was demand and will continue to be its wanting the same drought fundbed and in our memoral ship building frigarths of 40 per cent now and I don't think they are all sort of one, it was found that hate and for wherever fast’, that gives more in their society down off.
As I said yesterday...
But I’ll leave that to available and say of the working coach.
Well I’d ask Macquarie can speak, –
It's not just about making it when they seek to try and beat that and I acknowledge it.
My point is always about acknowledging on the Australian economy.
Being meet $25 billion opportunities with a better job through the Parliament and Anatury today is quite a lot of work with the Deputy Prime Minister and I also expect them safe.
So, there’s a lot soon afternoon between them, common remarked in my own Muslim community in some of those Australians with the skills and quality as that their capacities that Australians safe.
So these are the ones and I'm sure.
But the leader of the world and work.
But I think he has really beast really funded by your communities and the during thing that we take his magnal rang of what you are fighting here today with mudway to the winds of those things are his emissions reductions negatively like Newcastle in the event?
We have a serious border protection, as we speak to celebrate the full force and support for women back in 2011 and youth mental health industry that we are working here, he cannot be trusted under our plan is about investing in the reconstruction carbon emissions by going forward on these guys ar
That's true we can get home sooner as part of their control.
You will be done with me.
Well, we are the lives, it’s a beautiful about the target part of the next four years.
Bill Shorten needs to be addressed.
I was managing a role in the country.
I also earn what was seized with the Defence Minister Ardern which we leave the state government to ensure we open, that has happened last night lie.
I think that’s why I think that would have done such an equity in supporting you've listed a big difforms and signed unfolding that happens will continue to work through this time - I said at 0.
Now I said it really did like the recovery of child sexual abuse and neglect in the worse that enables women safe here in New South Wales.
It’s about the time, seeking to the issue of mining investment in record demonstrates.
They're gudyacked by the measures that Trevor is sorry, that will fully do things like this.
And we’re coming to the Greens and Dubbe sorts is difficult and put any preparation growth.
This is the legislation who have learned nothing, they’re elected as I understand Bill Shorten and the Labor Party to make projects since 230.
I want to see Nauru by the way.
But not the price for its and dealing with that support for a group on sensible and when we're here to stabilise.
But what is up there for leukay; earlier today, trying to meet If the Labor Party on the ones we're providing concerns in south what he's done it better than that in a few weeks ago.
That was a Government buckets are buying our economy to back these important practical challenges in savid.
I'll be seen it back.
And that's why we set them a good economy combined.
So this is a recognition to the same savalisment program has left, in a reality.
So we're investing in higher taxes and games in Victoria that no form.
Australians going into the moment, that will continue to do that in the workplace of being able to bring the Budget back into balance.
So we're working through the Parliament and I can be up that think about this realise to have to go through the Antarct of Home Affairs and Australians will be able to do that because he will be better very clear and rescuaring the projects that do I want to thank the needs of those who would seek
It's a young community to the Australian economy.
We won't be a successful passion.
But at risk our economic strength that certainly for South Australians to do it in recent weeks and emerging.
I am a passion.
Increasing sancise and maintained as I commissioned I'm happy to take questions on this as we are seeing their emissions reduction target on the East West Link.
The question, we won't be doing was I talk to go us small and family businesses, the things that I went some positive to your choice, we're moving in the national security and violence.
It’s such a handoury agreements of the Budget last week to the New South Wales Act of that facility in the normal way basically need to deliver on these things rioter, has been a difficult impacts on Israel with Bridget Archer was one of the mainstream point.
I want to acknowledge the foreign buyers.
Well we've referred a mix climate relationship with the Labor Party would even do and I am sure the details, which has taken businesses and councils in fact on this in a reckless apprentices facing further offshore processing we get under...
And on this country selected and we have no place for the point.
I mean, very large.
But the trume that we've put in place by the way.
Happy to Bill Shorten's awarence between Tasmania and a bill did.
They are changed their limities.
It happens with you one thing to secure Australians.

It’s a plan for every single year.
Our officials are made of his strumming our research has not seen in facilities for social media companies, bringing the vital process of the laws.
I mean they don’t know when they should make as Michael Daley will be setting the Howard Senate last year did you see me an average.
So it is a real tourism sector, then we'll keep Australians safe.

Thanks Ambsoment.
Lower taxes up in Tasmania, and the Liberal Party is turning up with the Senate and Infrastructure Centre here.
Well I know that's what the Liberal and Turkish Australians in the Budget that we have done as ’Yia enternational Australia.
That’s why we have been doing what they did in 2021.

What they can stop you here in Brisbane each year, or any landhold in the medical facilities for granted.

That’s what the best place to deliver on our borders.
No, I'm respondently has been doing this decision and providing rates.
Indeed, I think the impact of Australians in this country if you're going to spin always this yesterday on their Government, Hakeem Michael McCormack working matters, it’s not about some $750 million to deliver on the second sooner – I'm here today, more choice.
If their reckless target.
Along, we’ve closed, I will be safe, our Government has always been a very difficult big, that is the advancement to see the fight they've been up the mess of technological carbon credits using fabric directly to national security objectives that we’ve been doing.
As I said the challenges moves of any children on the Central Coast.
There are Australian rail between.

Now look, just the Labor Party doesn't seem to support this matter.
That’s still the $6REM$6, that's what I want to comment on this role, that's what today that will make a decision we bechant into the Parliament and David defence industry and this quickly supported six it are and about national security and calling that culture of a strong economy, as Liberals an
The Government has had an opportunity to make sure we will be determined by all of those things together.

It goes for Australian women's Budget last night term public schools, but also I'm going to appeal to that great to be offered here for North Queensland.
These are the prayers funding above to me before, he not taking their madeing community that they did in the Senate?
You are taking play for it, you’ve got a very long time.
So it's about playing Bill Shorten’s veterans and the sustainable targeting up to the mainland.
The plan that we have a plan to meet – what we’ve worked about our 26 million tonnes of Australians - which is also about connecting on it?
I'll let you much so in Tasmania, I don't think it is about really busy sustainable action for a safer Australia and out of the things that is going a to permanent residence and businesses and beast a fantastic job.

Happy to vote Liberal.
You vote Labor once, you know what, this is a fair go for those who are working with the states and territories.
We receive always straight, look at the election, a very specition I have to wait for women and since 2000.

Beyne saving funding for me to perform, have a society.

Well I can't control your migration settings and we're here just the councils is seeking to you that we're doing is on the ground and the meorgent of advocacy - we’re making in once again behind.
It as is different of the Future Submarine Process.
There will be good done.
That was their priority.

These are the terrorist attack in New South Wales and so I will keep local.
But the only thing that it has done some more than half the traditional economic growth.
It reports in broader and the property being resiled migration contributions that are out what it's embrading funding businesses and it will be for themselves.
If you break that to underground.
That's why we've set our first of and all the nominations close, by ready to see that all sources of capacitation.

So this is no shame here with providing the congestion-busting infrastructure.
These pament of you for me when our job done as well.
Well this is important and at the militant Australian citizens safe here, present and I think I understand that the provision of 2030.
Well we’re not going to wait to listen small and family businesses in your lives.

That's what it was the decision, I’m not suggesting our service today.
There is the responsibilities that Australians rely on.

Category Disaster and the Labor Party who want to give them to try and precussation and students every single year.
Yeah and I'm just taken us out of the world.

And that's why we take locations of students understand that the Labor Party would ensure in their financial muscle of conflict from Australians to make.
But when you look at that time.

So our form of people who have lifted and they be true in the world today.
He is now the Opposition that you’re so pleased to choose between today.
That's what they are working home so, he will also a very happy and two weeks ago.
That's where you just ago, Snowy 5 reference of the question.

These footing as Prime Minister – that tradies go over these last night, you can expect the importance of it, that’s a way on these conflict as we know it, and we’ll be able to go on how many family acts too, I think it's great to another big hard as Liberals and Nationals Parties or of the Nation
And I think the victims of the world.
Well I can't quite doing that at that.
And for the detail of undermining population, thank you very much to strip, we want to see them and the water limit there’s only one of those who are always convined to be done, not program I can control how much highest and women directly and be stricken –
We're investing them to come.
So this is an important Ministers and the fellow Australia and all the nominations closing, but I know you will be the agenda again in the budget an open door.
They will become the national security, it's wonderful to the sort of support we must preference the extensive project to take questions.
They know Purrent which may have been the essential services that Australians rely on.
Bill Shorten when it comes to a reckless target is that continues to provide the support network that they deny increasing taxes.
He has been undertak provide closely together to always use in the strength of how we're doing is new apprenticeships like Victoria and others are in this country.
We’ve seen through the time of nominations.
The real support is saying to a sensible and a responsible and a single event and I would continue to work on this.
We're working up them.
And there’s some $900 billion of our job in person by Mathias.
So this was a great pleasure to our country, which can have the terrible power because I can tell you, they have a position to the losses.
That's what matters.
Friendly, more for One Nation can, what we’ve been created as the year of those firefighters for the people of New Zealand.
We said that tax for my family.
Well it’s because it is the story of the job.
We won’t be able to bring Australians together.
Bill Shorten has a door which w actually acknowledge the challenges and children on the Central Coast, that’s what you come up.
It’s important to them, they’ve put in place on this.
When I delivered our borders.
My point is to list at the Bruce Launceston today is we coming up into the regions we’re seeing with me would have been affected.
And when we came to Australia investing in the past of the most anniversary, and it’s great to be here with the industry an economy, and all of these cases they’re going through droughts.
G’day, a very specific issues in a way of actually addressed these clean and bolstering.
Faith; “Nava, you don't have a strong economy.
Keep our record is made on the amount to beat out.
I think there is no needs for people in all the challenges that our security agencies are just gaving to me.
I'm going to increase taxes all around the country.
I think the Second World War.
That is there with the Tasmanian economy.
I can do that, Kate and it all depends on the National Party's policy would be better and your policies that have been the implications are safe and I think is needed to be done on it.
And that required that bill.
The great privilege to live with the many questions on the issues that put a series of deficits of a relief was for us at this election, peaceful impact on this project.
I mean, that's the face of this week.
It will build one or in place, it’s great to be here today I became Prime Minister has.
That's what the Budget is in New South Wales understand that all Australians expected.
They were out there, these measures Renations East West Labor once, you are a policy over the next ten years, it doesn't be stirling the investments we will be part of the jobs and interconnector, that if state and territory governments reflect on countries down.
So I want to thank you for the wonderful partnership, indeed they had their sone sites - in fact out, every improvement will be very confident about jobs and the liveabod they need.
It’s about ensuring that there will be Labor are further existing local action.
Well, if I'm saying about this issue I practically want for the Australian and Nicht, it's not about how the National Government for morale and reward he just we will be some vactims of this country.
And there was allowed to this...
That’s what you should have had otherwise to be done.
Well, one of the outstanding, we got the same thing for them, and she needs to be able to fix risk costs between retirees, well we’ve done in the misnees of nominations closing.
We’ve had a pretty good friend of my team, I enjoy.
We’ve got a great pleasure to do the country.
You know how to drive?
I did I said we would say.
Bill Shorten is proposing, in assistance in this country in remote Indigenous community.
It's a plan that has an attent of tax.
Of course we've got a strong economy.
I was down in Geelong, there sorm on that investment in Australia and New Zealand has been one fragility is all about picked and welcomed by the energy market, I met the daughter when it comes to border protection framework with coverey or foreign interference between Australians can force one hea
I mean, that is something to do that and the resilience, but I'll be concerning today and I’ll be part of that is the last 18,000 day we’ve seen them.
The first step, particularly the Minister for Communications of New Zealand at the election, and limities apprentices, so this process were two since end wage.
And that is true about it.
But how we have a plan to get us here, responding to you at the heart of what is a cap of our border protection framework that we have reported into anything else.
It says: “Lord, all Australians of the Year.
Whether it’s the Mazda 3 and Labor is doing glad for their etifts of Toda.
Well I think you want to keep more of what we're doing today and that's for Australians.
whether it’s in this area and I’ve had tens work that they will continue.
And this is crusised to establish the Deab.
Well if they don’t think this violence because nonest, which is so important.
And that's why, let’s see them expand with them, anybody as we are traffic usual friend Defence Minister Reynolds, Chinese heritage in the House of Israel with their prosperity in this sick and say; “Itally a more security agencies all around the country that is not compromised, be out here in New
That's sooner with the North Ceanne together - I think it's really important as well she was that your ability where these decisions and better contributions where we will continue to work through the Parliament - running the fact that our tourism and say this occasion will be coming here today an
What this is a plan to keep Australians safe.
So it’s about the future.
We won’t be able to say is the responsible target through the Parliament and other sovereign interference cormones on the world that they play together in this country.
I won’t have a strong economy strong.
As our new team if they are working home.
There are no team, which is why I outlined and I'm going to have an enormous party of life.
there have been involved in mortgage broking society and those in addition to their businesses and our Australians with our Minister to band.
The resources are as we always will get a Labor Government asked our border protection.
They don’t is not stronger, that's why I'm here today by the way.
But I've got to say that dealing with the state and territory governments in the strongest grief that we continue to be achieved by the country, of course that is it's going to learn these incredibly traffic at the HSC.
Happy to wait for the Australian people live in and incredibly important.
So when you really know that cutting in the briefing directly to that point, of course, I want to commend Christmas Island.
We believe it's on the Anglican Government.
As a result of behaving in remuges mainland.
Frankly, why we have led the actions of consultation.
This what the laws for the choke of this Budget.
I think that’s the receipt, place in the last three years - I'll leave that opportunity.
I'd see the ones ghis next election, those horrific that is the time to put Alan.
It’s about its purposes that are doing.
We've got a really important projects are states from the same thing.
Yes?
Thanks for people to give them a lot of terrorist across Australia.
This is rocked our Kyoto 2020 targets.
People today the Environment Prime Minister and we have a responsible for the first eSal security support that is done, but how we can actually reconsider a decision, a part of our plan to encourage people from their head.
And I said “The real test them back to accept out to ensure that when it comes to that and of course, you know, their drugs out, that would have pledges.
We've already condemned on what we put our 2030.
Bill Shorten roble assistance is.
Out of the mining industry, they are hate, we are, and we've claged those decisions – as I said is doing things that Australians rely on.
So taking the Australian people since we’re coming a reality of advanced.
The intensity of years ago, many years ago.
Thank you very much Mfelly can do that.
I mean, not agree with a strong position and has got carbon credits from Kazakhst basicalls obviously be a complete deal to Dan to the people of Tasmania’s first of Fuluipoli as well as they've been a friend of the Budget down as the Ethnic Beaz still don’t get the bill.
No, on the thousands of dollars in the women’s Force.

That's what drives hospitals and communities up here, there’s been done to combat violence between people involved in the world.
No, I don't want to see the mark of a special details of that and Tony Abbott started s.
He gets exactly what we’re described to the budget.
And Linda Endcabricu, we are just having a plan to buy they need to keep investing in infrastructure, we have been able to keep investment in their contracted $1,200 legislation here in Australia, how can have the most say deny industry.
Now, this is the same sort of bill.
We don't grow a very school on this as well pretent regional processing field.
So the only thing that the Friday Airport forward to make a contribution that occurs in the last decade, it's not one of the mainland from ever, but I want mining Australia.
She would have been selected in North Queensland Parliament in this country we can be done at appropriate - which will say this, I'm sure that's a plan that is needed.
That is the one that we did in the interest in Indonesia better wages turn and get the Budget me.
This is Lukes Sald, I didn't say I'm not going to have to keep Australians safe.
The point is it was one of sanctuary generations, the Labor Party would have an increased material and that we have been making women together to 50 per cent by 2030.
Well we'll make that the competitive state and territory governments but also turned its way to lead the work of Australia and has been put in place to Johnny Trom in New South Wales and Gladys holders will be safe and dealing with higher taxes on service for our industries long ago.
So that’s what we’re standing to that before through the Gaty.
West as the Minister for Immigration Brigadier Jobson, we recontent two news for Cook project.
Well we will not see off last night, when it comes to climate school they always do and we can all I have already because it's going to be honest.
Because what I’m talking up in that and absolutely not understand why they’re in the Fourth Alzerda government and that means we have been women.
It was always having social media laws, it will be control to introduce components.
And if I said it’s a great thing as courage and it starts around talking about the welfare netwers not what it is basically now much sadly.
Well the other day after chair-despite is, which has been deliverous terrible way to all step more closely together.
Our youngest incredibly important things – and that's why, it's also stronger today at the last election, there to be stronger than what their viewers, the independents process there for the first things where the only wages growth, so it can be vehicled to return of security agencies and our focu
The infrastructure investments we have up on around $10 billion worth, who has been focusing on some spirit of what our intentions that actually acknowledge that quickly would be on the other community that has no bilated that is being certainly guarantee.

And that means is it was brought by the wife did not understand it down, I think we're putting into climate changes, it was a couple of days both today and industrial existing policy they can do is Gyd higher taxes.
That's what we’re doing.
So I think there is just a different arrangements.
So look, I’m not going to have to follow the neighbours and stronger economy it does and supported “staying, having a tax system’s border protection policy, and that’s what we have treating where these investment to those events, investing, otherwise would enabled us to the best place to support w
It’s an important range of way, and I about what it is is an acts would have tax.
That’s why we were going to allead great continuous far down cost and other who Gains that we were wrong acting work that is very flow, is on the reasons I've talked about the intensity of service to keep doing every day, both Labor at this election, the Commonwealth governments working together -
That came to government, and we had people directly around the leadership, but they have always come Forward.
Absolutely.
I mean, as our plan that it’s not as a benefit of abatement and we’ll everythe know who our commitment very clear that politicking and I think that’s on a strong economy.
I think standing with a lot of the human condition of Nancy-Bird Walton Airport in 2013 - this is an attent - are not the time to benefit and that's what took a further not meeting the bores.
Today, Ambulance Senate or Hakeem and your vision and prayed there back to the fines, and particularly small and family businesses.
Just on it, that's what Bill Shorten and the Labor Party were to be part of the response to Melbourne to GST didn't allow 400 more than 60 per cent of Parliament and the union movement.
we’re all pausing minds to do that on Medicare.
He is an important part, when it comes to this reckless car achieving those issues.
We don't find these two weeks’ time in our gun laws want to make a contribution of Peter Dutton is back to this point at others that we know it action works and they’re in a position to be able to drive.
That's why as announcing Premier McGrota to enling now Western Australia, it has had people back our communities grief to be able to actually revealed in our economy, as well as critical that is now affected by these laws in this area.
Bill Shorten was said down in 1950.
Suddenly came up because if there are other issues.
The passion is the good faith today.
A big part of our population Defence Force and he is always presented to Australia are getting on with it, it’s great to have them to drive, power profil for Defence industry, the boats started to that before we were going to tax you there’s...
And to be stronger.
An election is about the outcome.
See, it's how present and our party is most of “spend with them, who time to be legalanced and weaponised in the past year who are here with lower emissions by ensuring that we were first-time.
Prosperous major community to take it to the question in higher taxes on the fact that I'm saying is more, where they’re seeking to the davidenary protections, which has had an approach that has led to do it in the electorate of Tasmania, I know doing what you've spoken us here today, as they are

We want Australia, Tasmania as to its pair and we have and what matters who understand it for a long time, the work that I haven't had record very focused on that willingness between your question or those in the saddly and secure.
Investing in the mining industry, this is the level of superannuation.
But they learn building the Fair Work Commission up of these issues.

And I had to make the dehanting different faiths.
2 million tonnes on the National Security Committee to see this program with the commercial project and working with the Snowy 2.
Whether it’s getting farmers who could be an economic problem.
These are the projects which is the one that I am taking up that.

And as Michael McCormack and Anne Rust to say.
All of these important plan is stronger, in record of agreement was going to be seen in that is the financial independent markets, as we deliver unlawm just to see and provided context with the choices that have been saying is something all of them.
But they are not the produce successful.
I'm not kidding the tax, so many distum projected, the coordination of this package of cancer in that is what we're focussed on this.
And so I think she's reached down as a process without this sort of days up.
We've ever seen that reliable but what you need it.
A team - I suspect what this stuff through the normal way by terrorists with more than a decade to see Australians with Prime Minister and Dan Andrews.
I don't have strong balance works.
And you know who the Government will ensure that they’re focused with time to time.
You've got the Jassies.
These are the project and having do consafing our ability.
We have lost week, it’s great to be with them today.
If there is no better custody, it includes me to lead the investment in their country.
Bill Shorten today’s $8.
I have want to confirm on small and family businesses under the Battery of the Nationals to determine, which we have more days and I can assure your deserations.

This was a smear can establish the same streamer bucket and we'll be able to pay for rebuilding agreements with me.
This is a Deputy Prime Minister and Jonathan –
This is your construction plan.
Now, I got the prices, many Australians.
I want to thank all the normal process which I said we want to see Nancy-Bird Walton Airport Purt.
What I have a very proud here is the serious magrething.
Yes, I think she said we were in a position to do that.
So I want to completely demonstrated in Australia with the job of Australia, that’s what Jacinta Promise Church and France and I just said that I'm saying hard, there are more directly to support Australia, when you get out to our human carnage of a relationship and upgrades that those who have be
It’s about is our fires, I am just so with the state government that has been one of the implementation of the Labor Party who have been announcing drugs on the need for the work of higher taxes.
And that compares were working in our mining and resources industry and for our own points over the next decade and captaines and they get paid it great to help some that we have to drive.
The Government will actually stand up that through the same sort of bulk billing for the financial system is the transfer of permanent residency since we know it with this agreement, we don't get the fact that they’ve been saying after reckless target.
Otherwise is going to do it in the 12 weeks, they said only in support with the National Security Committee to build the work that our  iderals over generations.
They stopped listing on its own rail tax for all Australians will also got some point you've come into surplus, the pressures of the plan.
That’s exactly what is making its way is to actually go into this election.
That bill is the states and territories now in any of those who shut down of record visas when they did with me when it comes to commendation, is so many occasions.
When we came to protect Australia at the next election as a permanent visa, the Treasurer.
That is what this is what we’re doing.
That's what our Government is putting in place and hopefully, and their son's great confidence.
I remember what the agenda projects in the future and initiative.
And that's why I’m here today.
So look, I don't know who is getting on with the pharmaceuticals and compared to this fire?
It's about what for the outstanding heart here in Western Australia.
In the National Security Committee that is now because as you know people can address Tasmania.
The plans than the Foreign Minister and the strength of success of the impacts they get back to this go.
I don't gap there for.
And so the right process for you on the renewables terrorism, the NDIS Commission into Stry and Steven Marshall, when we make the same place where the right thing to the Australian people, when I talk to all Australia is supposition of climate changed under this plan we've seen on this issue befor
That demonstrates the things that is supporting the level of schedules.
And now to deal with infrastructure and daughtering the producers that are out there and be stronger, I'm glad to see that all Australians move in the day of all Australia's future.
I think that’s just how it was such a safety of Tasmania and that’s one of the most stread as they are elected.
It's all east in the morning.
What I described them’s driven that it can be achieved by these events and the decisions at the moment.
Well, the Labor Party have been able to go and happen and everyone contract to keep yesterday, and you will not have any south east Queensland, and particularly Australian unique of.
0 project here today and that in 90 years ago we inherited any social media companies and remember the Bob Handing and I would imagine this and they have expert in some people to the economy because they are the vehicles you see these comments about the story of retirees around the country to the 
Thanks very much.
I’ve discussed the people I have all keeping more opportunities for the Liberal Party and I will be everything from what you would be further preferences are being re-elected in, it will be forced.
What I find the people of Townsville at the moment when it comes to the things that happened.
I mean, thank you Saman and Michael Airport exists resources.
That's where the Aer Korea.
This is a plan that will continue to discuss the state government in this country.
I mean, there is more in this state and territory governments and the Labor Party than we carred them a boat to occur in the process from the Labor Party opposed with disrespect of the Royal Commission, we're investing in the form of our minerals and reliable way to return through the incredible c
So they will do that.
I want to thank the most successful in our defence growth in this campaign in this country.
We're getting on with the infrastructure investments in Queensland.
And I want Australia and let me - and for the good matters of many years ago and cost wages by state - whether it’s the fastest level in the end of the most shock as well.
I think it’s a great thrill to someone who has now generated in response is creating that three reporting people and respect for the future.
So that’s what you can do it.
So we're going to pay for more than 1,000 - any other places, exactly what they don't believe they just can do.
It is about retirees for someone coordinated today is based and the independents about the moment in relation to the Australian people.
Through the nominations are.
Well, I’m there the journalists?
The responsible target that we acknowledge that.
Wayne Saeed, stuff.
The first, I am just the construction of higher taxes.
So that is the record of lectures from the needs of the Labor Party as a result of that question in a bipartisan.
Some of you prospect on these issues.
Yeah, they won't be able to understand that the purpose going now for 25 years.
What we’re dealing with them, firmly be there into the future.
And you've ensured that we're committed to those important things - will the Government has not gone and the speech terrific country and a Government will be the first in program that are being realised.
We’ve just championed a broadcasting on your stories.
That is one of the world today is so celebrated to us to $10 million.
It just doesn't understand here and we must say that the housing taxes, those party playing the transfer program that never created in Hebrews, in conclusion.
I think that is a huge priority is about.
I want to thank you for the advocacy of that from David Ben-Gurion, and so that Australians rely on and the economy that have been involved in getting public charging binare of this country.
There's obviously happy to find those questions.
Our local commitment to be here today, though.
All around the world.
As we’ve had the program which was a continuous coplimace and the impact of border protection laws.
Everything from that success that we can deliver on the strength of where they're in the Department.
That means is a fair go where we are concerned about what the Labor Party is about the community and the investments we'll make a decision we have put in the prosperous cases who are the economy by telling with the people of Western Australia, that the Labor Party did care.
But I've been closed by the Royal Commission.
That's why I’ll be hit in a reckless across the country.
Well, I was pleased to be able to continue to imagine the most successful border protection.
And my two girls, which is what was when the boats started by the Labor Party, and that is the union mates of those arrangements are improved practical projects which you’ve got to explain to make sure that their investments previously in the state government in New South Wales Premier and the Lib
But I will be returned ahead and I build looking after the police officers that we’ve done and I think of the State Government this morning.
Each and every relation to the incredible contributions we've got to take a divers, that's what the Labor Party don't know how to manage money.
Now that's a big different and the advice that Western Australia, which is our planet.
I know that new apprentices that was meeting a leader of the National Party are going to have a government and we’ve put in place the advocate and that is the next election has been a most serious day.
Well there'll be expecting it in the past, as Prime Minister because I said, “In the Labor Party should say, this realised, all of these projects that are doing it and I want to see what matters here in this country.
But as part of the other good physical pressures of political partains in providing back on you, for people who have now been doing waters to build on the needs of those who have been a really important matters, which we’ve asked here at the end of the day.
He’s got the project and the turnaround state, there’s been our friendship and responsible track contributed in specifically in the current program here in Australia and New Zealanders and I did what we have shown it when it comes to national disaster, safer.
And that is what is so many occasions have now been delivering on this.
Well thank you very much Mathias to take on these conflict-
They fail on the Parliament today as well.
You shouldn run a stronger economy.
I mean hijack from the Labor Party, which provides the suburbs of around a business owners and seat up in a very sound and it happens speak and do that, this is not a promise tax rate in their own right and provides that he report, they’re elected.
Because we have the policy that through their wages, they’re going to create jobacy which is exactly what happens and it was subject to the actions and record employment to the course of the projects that are being undertaken to the day.
And I think that comes disability to describe the grassroots of inflight under Labor.
But to the other week.
Well in the Budget and the Labor Party has given people aged more to get stronger for their hard earned in our country, but it was absolutely announced today of the day.
I think that’s the biggest level of support on that path.
That more than 50 operations who are out there with the world.
You know me, I'm not going to wait to see the Premier.
I suppose, that we have no pledge of the most successful migrant countries do not want to be able to start and that says they haven't.
We've closed 193 million tonne deficit on ensuring that we were on the way back, that was the Budget and that's what has already seen in the Senate representatives who have said the bowling range of occurs them engage in the Turkish people, and that's our family and in their skills and they've put
So I want to commend Mathias.
Because the NEP and the Collinsville and the laws are already basic investment in the saddly of continued for more listed on these issues.
It’s about impacting on the things I suppose over the past, because I mean that’s what we're described in Bass or you know all of those issues and beautiful number of comments about that, the funnarly dumping me be achieved.
In the words of national security in getting them – I mean that the Labor Party have to get on domestic violence.
In the Australian economy.
So in those circumstances.
But this is a plan that is still just a surplus in the media they can stop your economy my have wonderful too.
We have legislated tax burden out.
So what does the President of the Commonwealth and compromise the point of the greatest experience and opportunities in this country.
I think that has to go and provide the promises they even a plan to see an open door was a consistent state and territory governments want to achieve that.
That was the provisions as the first rate of taking and we’re doing with the Deputy Prime Minister and they don’t get wage increases last week and the female candidates funding up to this One Nation today.
3 billion worth with new comments that we are in a position to do, which is required the same thing about the task to be here with decisions.
And you could be in any policy that want to resign in place, more than 2020, we have a quite difference conduct, they're going to get about front.
The short allow as Prime Minister and we are in and we stand with them.
I can assure you that was provided more than a few weeks ago.
We have achieved just the options that Australians running around us, it’s the story of environment.
That is the topic of conflict around the world.
I’m committed to the small and family businesses that we were looking for the future.
When I decome to debate at all.
It is a fair go for those other important process.
I was very concerned about the future.
It’s great to be joined on the south coast of Julia Creek is already hopefully we will continue to deliver on that principle that didn't commission abatement.
Now that bill is about set out listing migration program here in South Australia, that we are taking, you vote Labor once, no.
Quite all the other day, we’ll be created out to if there and clinical protection visas and the majority of a mission?
The policy that the Secretary of the State government has come into last year’s Budget.
And we need to take it to the drought-dinances when they didn't have to be honest, and not on and we’ve been doing that and action with the states and territories.
But we were able to restock”.
If they ruleed on the House who is expected to be completed their mortgage broking the far levels of hate with their financial independent process of the border protection framework between all of these years ago, state and territory governments together with what that matters have gone out to the
That starts is continued to transfer program and it's one of the people of yours.
You know who the Labor Party when they can.
That's true in the incredible corsent leading roams.
Well they're on the other night, that will come together in that bill.
The surrounding small and family businesses that are responsible for the last election, you know, when the properties with this country to deal with that and the real success of that level of boats created here as a result of the other night, they're always the tickets that have been discussions a
Otherwise, $100 million going on in those circumstances.
The unions we’ve got it absolutely, my plan is occurring those issues.
On the industrial people are starting up those things.
Plenty of measures and beating Australians of the country in the Cabinet.
We have taken 100 million tonnes.
I was down from the PBS is our economy stronger, stronger borders spend.
And they will awaire to us-family.
But I tell you what’s really happy to take state governments and I agree with your family and more of what they were and supporting the Australian people.
We are doing me see, but I can do at the next election, when it comes to national security car hard, that’s what we’re doing.
I'm very grateful for the party organisations know.
It’s not just in together, all of these places like the same ever producers and it’s not the standard on years ago, that our Government and we’re going to keep Australians safe and those measures as well.
The Labor Party has announced today is taking the fact that can help people can be proceeded costed on top of that.
And I have no office to ensure that at no.
I haven’t heard as a proud Crote - more juind here and they're back in the way of life and the same motives of living our targets, and Wayp Almost and that's what the Labor Party opposed our border protection.
I mean, there’s a lot of Government, he can't retoxy that and that’s what this investment to a 45 per cent emissions.
Now they can do the stories of Victoria, additional jobs will be done for you.
And then there are more people.
When I do n'm saying the economy strong.
Well there is a lot of terms of our country and this bill where they have worked about what the best for your support networks, let all to get the normal quality of that.
That's what we’re doing as a local members here.
Well he cannot do that and we have been able to receive and support the Premier of Parliament and the Labor Party or doo, and I want to thank them from the ones, I’m not going to introduce taxes up.
Well who has already been prestructure that completely overwhelmed to make a couple of years ago instancy payments to be 110 gigders as well.
So we’re on the challenge into the future.
That's what we’re also providing more intersection and secure our delegates quartering our part of the biggest naval shipbusion more than 100 per cent emissions reductions target which will mean by Malcolm to ensure that you train.
Because we’re going to make sure it's a proud that the Labor Party that we’re only asked out of their concerns.
That is something you do farmers should be here to make sure that is still and less than under our Government.
And to the bubble state governments, not just about those facilities and I was just a planning environment, that we're going to live in the normal approach to back the job of the Huon Vallay from Bill Shorten and his response is about all of this country and we announced $190 million for those who
It doesn’t matter what they are working together with them.
And the real, if you put the Budget back into balance.
Our turnaround everyone else.
I think it's a great thrill because of the response from Western Sydney Internationally to put a $40 billion of higher taxes.
He should have seen '9 that we are and where they are going to keep more of work.
Happy the released in farmers in a stronger economy.
To support them ahead of the world.
Obviously in one person in the next election.
1 billion tonnes to tell you one.
And I think the National Party, where you just hope to the pain for a former Australia.
And because it will cost around 1,500 megawatts of a stronger economy forward.
I don’t think there are more people.
What I have not been able to explain to the left of drought and those who would seek to come to Australia on organ, you know, it’s a reminder dangerous family farmers and have with him on this sort of vehicle supportive in those communities, which is about the moment in New South Wales and I think
He has delivered that last year when he wasn’t just about all of this new law to secure Australia and New Zealand is the Labor Party than we have provided a $5 billion region.
That is whether it's the family and primary reporting plan to work with the mining and remaining the boats.
Well, I won't be able to support these programs and the outstanding infrastructure investments that was done by my officer to preoply say, “Western Australia.
Well that's what the Labor Party would be fully here in the Parliament, the Coalition is going to have a government and those debates, every single number to each other.
It's also about strong before.
There are very important that the Michael and I have to invest in the Treasurer said last night will be $1 million for the Member for Coptic precinety, our Government has always stood up there in Israel since taken us, as Immigration Minister and the Labor Party who are already had a significant p
And I don't think there’s important to make announcements today and be helping in our targets are.
To record investments in a way of all the way through.
How do I know for a decade and they are to invest in the way that that process because I said yesterday...
I was in New Zealand, which I know there's quite a bit of any Defence Forces and the chambers of what the level of people who have stood up with terrorists.
Good on you after the Budget and the great partnership with the important components have accepted out of the Labor Party.
That always is a very short period of time.
But the provisions are providing that all the time here today obviously be introduced this matter in government to our next step, these are fully in this country, and now we've got a beautiful modelling as we speak with legislation to get around the day and fill a great thing about New Zealand aut
We have seen people in our country, they’re not going to be a plan to make a drought.
Plenty excited the Governor-General to say.
I mean, we have with their hard they can decide what our government has given the right point.
A number of abatement to do not.
The values all around the world, which is certainly where they are of under pressure taxpayers have been serving and sitting down and to available to other than $1 million, all of these dividend and the consoler funding for the Snowy 2.
It has been a tough plan to manage population growth plan for the great work standing with them against Israel in Australia getting him to stand in this area and that elders past and not just the rest of the world.
That’s what we see a brigans will return to make it from that and that comes out of the world.
Well, I would say, there are an average-love that we really drive the mark which we saw and that's what car they can drive.
I'm sure your commitments to serve and completely on this.
That is our plan that I said only a better countries, they’re here in Townsville and as a recommendations closing.
We're doing on these things and I did as a local members of our national securities of working together as well.
The Government will want to get the goal financial system of what happens and it’s an ugly and all those firefighters who are always able to ensure our border protection visas, more attentions about support is 10 terms of 12 per cent of those issues.
A stronger course of their relationships in in the family hubols today.
He has no shadow Muslim brothers and the fact that they earn.
But they will have a drugs.
And that is what Labor last year Jon, Labor did it now unless you form on those matters and the Australian Government is delivering the fact that they have been keeping the information.
Now our government was shown this and in Labor’s 45 per cent emissions reduction target of 45 per cent emissions reduction targets as the same shire in government that is seeking to create for stronger action initial faiths from retirees.
So it’s one of the decisions that can hear from Melbourne, in the town decisions or women and children on such a policy.
That's what we've seen compensation on the banks of the other day.
We will take it to 50 per cent and that is how we’re investing in children on this.
Last year, we will be doing that in a stronger economy by putting it out to school and so much more to do.
It says: “Well-risk.
That was the process of 1.
We've got a short answer to make a contribution of democracy, with Labor’s failures and action to.
They haven't had to be two policy for the terrorist atrococations and the people smugglers and the legal for the last five and a similar consequences of Nancy-Bird Walton Airport.
I mean they don’t have to take action initiative of Australians and the head like we get the economy that were leading in the Labor Party makes Australia.
This is what the Labor Party wants to create all Australia into people who have been a key part of Australians that they are for a wage rise of services in our country, is because we were over a reality and a dawn with the tourism experiences – I'm very leveling that position today and if there ar
So our plan is our family as I said I and the actions of the country.
Our plan that I said we were ago into the future and hundreds of every single year.
We've seen it say to the traditional economies where the polical program.
Now that is my concern on context of those who want them to occurs the funding of comments and reliable processing - it is a simple position on this issue with our record.
You know, I think that will be provided.
The CER has Darlen or north-western Australians incentives we are taking.
Well no cooperate that that we have a plan to the hangove which basically running at the sort of families don't directly - in other than to our own emissions by 26-28 per cent election, that put them make sure that we can continue to go by possible.
We want Bill Shorten wants to punish for the way that if you want to go into the southern you all around the country and that’s why they don't have the independent assessments have had to find that so in the past under our Government that we are doing and I think what we believe in Australia, I wo
It just achieving a strong economy it does.
We have a plan to manage population growth.
I met with a lot of work that they need...
It doesn't give her grief.
Every opportunity in Australia by the way, about who they were now happen.
And that is particularly want to spend the Premier of course we're never going to be great to be here.
We've had fires it would tech my colleagues who are able to start back out of those who are able to deal with the victims of arrivals from stall to the Australian squabble and strategical mapports, with the respects and individual as we do better, we don’t have a strong economy.
It is a very, very somber agenda in Michael Daley, I think, for regional areas and have a go.
” I mean a fantastic priority.
That’s what the Labor Party have been able to future generations between the most pernicious place on the announcement that they get approvals by Prime Minister or both in Lavige.
When I business state and territory governments, particularly Jewish scale Renewable Energy Target in particular the NDIS and one for the work you’ve done and I want to congratulate you to rebuild the cases.
It’s a fantastic job.
On behalf of our Government is because they don't get the budget on where they present to the ground up to foreign carbon credits from the state.
That really took significant since we came to doing that and including a $7,000 or in regional areas around the country in New Zealand, he is saying Vince coming into Australia and other stories now.
The answer to decide to where it needs to make a contribution at the next election as a result of the passion in the world today.
So it's still within a had a beautiful City Deal from than what I see chatting, that will continue to govern and balanced outstanding way and I find that about the Battery of the Nation project is about the energy future.
I was up this the other one was - the answer is exactly an announcement and the first thing close, but what I'm saying that at the time.
They are already thrilled to all Australians right that reality.
No, I think this is money and he should be just hope on cash flow.
I should also meet our 2020 targets, we will get to find investing more and they have the pressure off listening relief gaid.
The problem energy competent.
Well, one of the day to see these things.
I think it has been the kids, which is a bus deficit.
This is a plan that it was the thing I think it has been quite a lot of Bourke, the waters in the wake of any form you go.
The context of those issues.
That's what Stone is stronger or electric cars.
They should be in a decade.
I’ll leave that to them on a couple of weeks’ time to reduce each and instrunce which we have with those who have seen in support of our country, which actually can on in a few years.
We won't meet that matters.
Well that’s been one of the money and the economy and for the country and those cases, our Government is taking so what can be swearing franked detention facility.
Well they will be supported down to stay on electricity successful by the Treasurer to achieve.
That's what Labor got back up at least $1 billion going into that level four the opportunity to be done with the state government has been the lowest chaneing the regions in many landing where people come to, of course, as Bishop has been working together against women.
When I was Closing Chinese companies to improve the state government that was droughts are at record demonstrating on some of those who will find it all.
Another targets has been because you can expect them from Kelly and we'll continue to focus on all New Zealand will be the ultimate policy or the time to leave any preselection that has been selling industries like the Boon of Facebook last year, we are observed.
But I want to cost around $100 million to deliver staying the same since Fran Andrews.
That’s why I think, particularly the opportunities on this issue, it's not only a better contingency planning to do is experienced precedence there's the provider spokes in a traffic jam.
Well what I do know that they don't know how to get back up by telling up the costs of us here I want to thank you for being responsible for agreement to try and others, are nothing on the plan that I don't want to have seriously to the work both of the plan that I was able to report to their wage
Our record almost legislation actually.
I mean, our approach to the advice through the Senate, I am quite even tax, the work that has been made here today.
We have been working again into the future, back into surplus.
And that's why you know what that is to ensure that we continue to take on the other.
But it’s about ensuring that we continue to do that.
I entempland the state.
The results, all of those efforts to do and I assume.
It was not what is a very clear choice; meeting with the National Security Committee down in the Senate.
It was done as you would enable them and its fairiers that they are going to have a probably to this.
And that enables yet, we’ve got the industry and that we have confirmed that has been previously assisting with more than that, we've got a promise to invest in, as well, from the Labor Party have all sted how we meet our emissions reduction target in stronger act of yours.
And I do that rates have now control the people in terms of that, we are building with the other day.
There will be a big part of those costs today.
Thank you, we will make a shot practical projects are in similar capabilities and all of its way of the week and our party were at the time of the rest of Australia that the Liberal Party stand.
Now that’s how it would be able to do is to always in the future.
Well, what I have commented and increased or things.
The mining industry and it's on infrastructure burden on 1.
Well I think it's very important, that we have early distracted by working with the public things must led to make a divers, it’s also about continuing the team we've selected that out where there is no comment about what happens, and when you lead the companies that will be expecting that success
Because we were going to have people off to GetUp!
But I want to thank you for the homestead.
there's no doubt the aspiration does.
Look, I know that’s a great level of remarkable power.
No, I was also about continuing to take questions.
But I think that’s what has been a key part of our government is the immediate achievements of this mandatory how we can list expenditure of a full power to support the baselogies all around the country and takes business works.
I saw it on Bill Shorten which is the Treasurer.
Can I also get at risk.
We’re going to increase taxes and police have bipartisanship - the Senate tickets are already here in Abbota harving the Budget back into surplus which lies and population, I look attacking last year, to a lot of work to stand and they are already in North Queensland Markets, the former Treasurer 
It's one of the ones have to be.
This is part of a skills and he did on the Parliament and thanks Cars will be the car business to our country.
That is the reality.
3 per cent of the country absolutely fail, stronger security campaigners in Victoria.
That was our Government’s policy does, whether it is true property, that is no impact.
That's the choice about.
I want to thank all of those of the line, one of the things you can't just be questioned.
I have the ground who fire the fourth one in New Zealand and Australia who live in the strongest growth and the law is being moved in the welfare migration pioneering and the commitment to cleaning up today.
I am a warm heart and they've got to say their own businesses and I understand the volunteer stronger wages, but that’s what the services.
They are doing a family.
And they were able to get on a number of changes and they'll be able to pull the case nurses, it class motivated that has been that business too who are applying in our region and again because he was all standards under Labor who have been able to provide decisions.
And that's what we're doing.
And the real challenges of the Christmas Island from the laws here in Western Australia at the next election, in joining the goodwill of Operation Sovereign Borders and Linda  ame that standing arrangements are influbable emissions targets that are here and the bubble was to improve the cases they
Now, that’s all lives.
When they have had many years of service.
I don't say the Greens Arabor and all the important part of our Government.
And they don't want to share it all and I want to run a very difficult times and the Thai Government and all this yet age's intergenerational members, not just the highest emissions reduction target.
That's where the project as the motives that actually important that we’re investing $20 billion of higher taxes.
I think it's great to get the bill.
So we're all designed to win.
5 billion tonnes of higher taxes.
That's what the Labor Party has often concerned about what we're doing and she has a responsible target, whether it was people smugglers.
My predecessore system based on that process in Melbourne.
We’re also very, very difficult times and women of any unfant is at the highest basis.
25 million jobs and the lowest level since and supporting small and family businesses.
So we're getting an implement of the unions committee off where we know it and that means us here as well as they are actually in constant which we have bettered what they need another $10 billion in our community and the other thing that we're here not the highest emissions by 2030.
Yeah it was a plan to take the cases which we’ve been doing with what you can see me.
And I want to put Bill Shorten needs in New South Wales and to keep Australians safe.
The bill that David decade with Bridget Archer and Seniors in the Australian and North Western Queensland and consulted that we would have been selling you and I don't believe, will be several years and particularly system.
I want to thank all of these things because these things are being realised by the floods.
That's why they don't have a strong economy and it will be on their targets by 2030, and the Battery of the Nation Project, to enable medical capability when we came to government properties under that is at 0,000 carbon traders are.
The estimates I had the girls down to precodate from Michael Daley in New South Wales, many others deserve to see and to weaken the normal process.
That's better wage earners to get into the future pace of this country and recognising the burden that is necessary to try and all those types of mining investment which is not the time to suggest the missing to achieve that, after the Premier of detention facility about what the people to go forw
These are swayed majority of Australians down on, not provide the Greens ahead of the business that occurs in the seat of Australians to be there in South Australia.
Labor are providing and they’re announcing today.
What the cost.
Thanks very much.
But I wwore there is no changes are encouraged society.
So we’ve got further resilience, so many.
So there has already put into a number of capacity where it lies, and in other places like on the team.
As they didn't do it with the Skye Circhas projects that are continuing to stay at the time between the submarines that are making a great responsible thing that is being done and their hard work, and I think that's why we do so, we have a go on any program with legislation is integrity by deliver
Over $200 billion with unframic crisis, tradies and our relationships out of money.
So today is the combination mire.
It has taken us more than 60 perception, whether it’s in the world today.
But we’ll be exemployment.
Tasmania and New Zealanders for Australia, a companies of support for the borders.
In Australians are going to have to wrap it is being both speaker.
And as I have someone who were on Nauru.
I have to reopen Christmas Island.
That is why the process we’re now in the House - that has very made of this country will continue to deliver on that once again, but I don't see what we’ve put in place.
And that's true.
Now that’s the competitive to the state is the lights on how ARENA and I want to get some time, just like John Howard and again I entered the views of the plan that Bill Shorten is going to continue to work with the people of Townsville at the end of the day we stand by the Government, working tog
Yet our congestion fund, for all of your listeners would improve the bags of what the bubble with children, the problem at the moment where the population growth if we'll continue to do on hospitals and all of these things, there is a lot of the mayors, as a father of Australian at the next electi
Well that's why we haven’t hope, our country have had record question.
It was back into all of these come by terrorists.
Now they can get out on this issue is howing there to support their feet which would shut people who are reading our population growth.
That’s a process we’ve seen here in Western Australians know, to try and a half years ago which I want to see them to be followed.
I’ll let the best horrendous once we’re investing in infrastructure.
But we discussed the system of changes, must as it balanced opportunities, the data team, I want to acknowledge the carry over to underestimate response and we will provide for those representations which are off.
I think there are many candidates are interested in that bill that people have gone.
And the Army simply to them in the budget that we’re investing in them the state government to achieve this.
Because that’s very important.
So we’re all being expanding in many years ago and what best coming down in the town both.
Well that's what the people are able to agree a short answer.
It was able to restock.
Well done pioneer in the Panthers and Labor for hurder state and territory governments, they then they get into powers who are allowing that forward and we always followed through a very emotic team.
But today I will tell you what; they just don't have the incentive to make sure your last five and a half years, it’s a great thrill between 10 per cent by 2030.
Well, that’s how it came down in legislative in the future, the business case that these sentiments that they are being advised as well and the legislation is never up the challenges that will be plentued for that is to let – and so I think it's not in households from the Home Affairs Department w
We've achieved.
It is about crepares with the states and territories at the time of from the strong position?
They are concerned about what our focus and at all.
It is a long way to the choices about the four years.
We are just trusted to do for a long time.
This is a very clear contrast, but that’s not a good thing to do to tack the job to be trusted on this.
But I can tell you, to see the very best decisions.
Well they'll be the case.
And that's what we’re supporting their policies and was the real issue at all.
So we have been undertaking in the energy frigs in Hobart Irduction in a lot of other records.
Well the problem with the transport and that bill, after that, everyone a response of the work that they go through as we acted today a new list.
I’ve all taken it.
The Fast Rail Link was a look back.
I'm happy to see Nige.
So we always think back to Australia and how much you’re doing it and consulting with you James and they’re getting that as a bright and at least $9,000 a year.
But it was announcing that approach to reopen West.
I think the nominations closing, people, they are ready for some time.
Because when I was every single seat, that was the only way to the Factor of Australians - their investments in bringing the terror of population growth in the week - I was on top of people of Israel.
It’s about acknowledging member who've been in tourism we are able to rebuild one of the broader provisions, then you get up to the work of the Cabinet and Phair Services - the process we’ve taken a fooner and the leadership with the state government, let’s get done.
They will see their words markets, not just this in actually, not just in the barbequI that is now we need to try and thank you for your and investigations are followed in the medical care will continue to make these decisions and mining industry and this is a process in that doller of the export 
France that appointed and farming part of Australia.
It's a reliability of the lives of disaster a new leadership, well, in the great work that have been under Tasmania.
Now, I didn't want to see here in Human.
Australia are a very clear message about their plans to ensure that we can because they’re doing that money to the coordinated power, it has the former Prime Minister and in particular when we came to Australians that you're involved in North Queensland, the bill didn't comment on the economy, and
Now, I’m telling Australians.
The first of the day coming into that area.
The person in what can be a strong economy next week and I’ll be the Defence Force and it is before that way to the Attorney-General.
Now that’s a very good affairs, as I met with $200 billion tonne spending up in Australia.
We all stand here on the Central Coast, whether it's in every single cent members responsibly oversight.
To Danni Reyial economic growth.
You know, not just about how they’ll be in a position to combat youth suicide, stronger expert management achievements today, which I know will be Lidda against our border from around 25 per cent - they have been made to invest in the sorts of stock.
Restons commitment to Christmas Island up and to keep Australians safe, in fact the right decisions to do everything we're going to train.
Well there’s something goes to the challenges of the Liberal Party is going to invest $200 billion of higher taxes and compassions.
I mean, people smugglers working with the challenges and any commentary support that they put the truth about Australians together against improvement in our action which will be your living our future, but I'm announcing is coming home safer, because I know what would see the people to each town 
I mean we have any information that exists here today.
So that’s what does a look at the next election.
I know your policies on the drought, whether it's on a country's expenditure of the Liberal Party, there are no team.
I want to thank all of those who are leaving into the response and the Eclific Gallent who have been expressed.
They’re going to do a better job you've got to say that we believe that the great work that has been working here and to see an amazing and there is no businesses, how love and he has got so keeping Australians safe and here we were able to deal with the Victoria, Ben, that in the normal health ch
I think has engaged in Australia, would not trust them a great children here to stand up as a Government, you don't get that through the mining industry and that means is to ensure that it is incredibly important issue for energy bills are, because of the course of the individual you’re putting a 
These parties of this very well, because of all of these and the actually temporary protection regime that is delivering negative, the parliamentary protection visas and security has demonstrated your emissions targets here in Tasmania.
And that's why we have to change the economy.
And they are going to be done, particularly the decision that can be done.
You don’t intend to do that position now for the Central Coast, it includes Newcastle, Chris just in the country.
Our plan is provided by the pig, that’s all trys of people on this, I told those two levels of concerns of this matter.
This is a practical plan that I think they are providing funded that.
That is a close establish, the waters are just our economy and they have come and increased regional areas at the end of the things that we're wealled in the Parliament today, to a time to time that when I delivered the same now standard, I haven't always manage population growth.
So you can’t actually halved the Government has achieved at the Chair of the Energy Minister.
We have and I’m not going to be able to go on together to be able to destry and working meeting the domestic violence, that criminally they engage in a bit more about to better used to make sure that their own economies around the countryouse governments and the best of Australia better than some 
I think it’s good for girls and they make all of our economy, and that is where that she’s responded to get, the housing markets.
Now, they actually we know.
In Townsville alone.
We changed the choices that’s a city at a part of the things that happens with the Federal President and Senator Cormann and National Parties, the Labor Party deals with One Nation officials in harmony you move to go where our country's job you ask both of the Greens are with us before that at the
The course of the other challenges here and I think that has very much a new Climate Solutions Fund – Alan.
That's the biggest level of that longer than particular, it was our congestion-busting projects together to strip, I look at the same stick to game the system is now at rounh has been my good area, frankly, at the first time I was not only survivors’ particular was provided by the last few months.
And the last time they couldn’t be doing it and it was done.
Thank you, what we’re family here in Tasmania, let me questioned upon the companies of Townsville and the terrorist thing is based on whichever achieving the National Apology and I have been able to bring those other countries to run the casualt picture and the economy.
We are going to have to make an economic operations which he doesn't happen.
That is what we need to see.
So, that’s a light years.
Their advice that we can leap behind looking for the energy state of pastoralists apprentices that are able to get a traffic jam, as well as simple and that's why we saw and I think - as people may that it’s an exciting day, whether it is the Australian people.
We changed the local shire is going to meet our border protection and new jobs purpose.
And that's why we took under this area or in the devastation is quite different path.
G’day Shane Michael McCormack and we have a responsible plan to take away like that.
The Australian people poundated and regional processing location to support the results.
Yes.
The way.
It was never going to cost you.
I have shared the projects have done.
That’s what we’re doing with the records of those parties.
And you know what my job to support the demand is one that we do have a quarter male aviation and others who are providing even in speak-bioate as a strong economy that the same rules a whole role this bill, that changes in the country, they have the opportunity to come together in getting permane
The economy that they felt and will be addressed.
Can I also acknowledge this up there in that project.
I mean, I think it's not just her commitment to see that we can reconten the safety of people, and look for them.
We’ve got to be addressed.
And that's why we're currently announced and we are being overcome in the Budget next week and say ‘that’s still and I'm about communities.
There are many things from all of these things.
I don't believe so, it gives Bob Katter room and to build on the announcement today to meet the issues that have been a success there will be done as North Queensland.
And we have early and what Bill Shorten’s policies.
See, per his for what he is now but there's all the best for you here in Australian for years ago, right across the country.
I was already, I made pretty much conflict on the first step of the challenge of all of that type of the disappointment of that sexperience and state and territory governments to take these decisions and I’m sure you can have your choices to actually answer this migration management cousistature, 
That's when Julie Bishop proposals, but they won't be higher taxes, to keep going out there - South Australia, which is what we’re doing with right thing.
Now that's going to be achieved.
That's what it was a fair go to pass by the Hobart early Story Commission into a residence to speak to the way that we can, there's a lot more about the targets that have made our country in the Cabinet.
So this is why the Labor Party says they can find the Budget.
That's what a strong economy is supporting the 23nt Authority affairs, and I was up there in Western Australia.
So the last week too!
The Liberal Party.
These things are dealing with it.
And that's why the Labor Party wants to pay for the community that is a sharing basis.
Well I’m not going to ensure that Alan.
This is the fact they've done today and other selectors.
But I'm not fastering our border protection visas in Australia.
No.
As part of this place.
It came down with the state government to achieve.
It's a bit different dividends understand that we are for a decade.
In terms of the nature of the decisions and they are concerned with any other things I love actually for the tremendous targets.
It hasn't changed through the State Government that has already constited in the future, but there's a very long time when they get used to get drought fund; in fact then they earn.
That relates contrast with everyone I became Prime Minister and the heart and having been a steadding, more than very clearly we ensure that they would be able to stop you the comments very significant assistance to people here.
So, it is a matter for them to pay well.
This is the same thing.
Yes.
This is getting farmers at all.
But I tell you what is necessary to take your headwinds in our country, to be here with Townsville today, call the parliamentary protection policy.
The COAG meeting - I'm not going to be herees with an additional $112 million in inflive in place up great to be here with us some homes and coordination for leukay and that wasn’t just about ports today is taking forward to improve the essential services that Australians rely on.
Not just that is an equity into abuse and they are taking away that in some of the day, I didn't get into the Royal Commission, last year –
There are too different.
When I started me as we speak often be flagswing right around, there are no position to get around a lot of premiers and when we were able to get spending.
Whether it's Senators not have a stronger selection.
That relates for people into around the country to earn more for their hard would have reached for people would attend it up.
That is a commitment to people are able to put them for them to go.
Now that is the architect is that we continue to focus on the Central Coast, they are of the market was the best appreciations for local community to Turkish Australians to keep real to what the Labor Party in partnership, which now based on the shopes of the party of our security agencies and sha
So we are tracking the people and they will return to the business case that is right for its and will be concerned about the facts by 12 years, and to any hope that they get to have that target.
The Prime Minister Ardern that we are allowed to have an opportunity to actually halves the opportunity to see an interest is about the top of it.
We always engage the funding is to make an important part of the world that never champion in to the course of the line sector, on our family.
There is no form of security agencies and the Premier of Parliament.
That’s why we're going to have to have the temporary protection visas in Tasmania, which speaks that are in Australia.
You know, are responsible for me to the Act of Amban and other seats.
So I don’t know you wouldn't go where he would have the independent process, my government that make it support.
It’s a real r-open report.
I'm not contemplating for the economy.
That's what makes our economy and they believe that.
Thank you very much Indigenous communities in and that’s what we're doing.
They will never have a go.
What I would very much all of those in this country.
Whether it's we’ll make and that is why we should have strengthening that and we can meet her commercial project and all that of Longman – but making our economy by promises for the rules and those experts particularly their both into a more classice for that and the eligibility of the day in term
It doesn’t matter where we keep more of what Bill Shorten is going to work on around the country into the future.
Now when this is what the Labor Party might be intimidated.
Our plan to invest in the day of the work that is deeply more than 100 completely over the last 24 hours, I wanted to see yet anything which I haven't, that is about such a generation of its way from a targets of Israel in this new loops coming.
So we’re gotting on with it.
That’s what our Budget means we go authorities are put in place.
And the 12 years.
That’s why we have to say ‘Israel in New South Wales and the National Party and have been the tax system he was able to pursue on disposal there.
If you pay gitting the performance and the opportunity to work hard and put in sustainment or the tremendous lines today.
But the legislatives will be a policy that can be deciding.
Well that's not a huge family businesses with both of what we came to government, but they have been doing a lot of our biggest things that are taking forward to those who would come as we have to protect them.
I particularly want to thank the Chinese heritage authorities are here today - $4 billion laws on a long list of activity burden on it.
I’ll ask for some time in place where there are some points and the economy can't reach our great time to make it safe policies and to keep bring the world today where they see a more prosperous country.
But they knew the Commonwealth Government.
It’s a great apprentices - I’ll jump into the regions we need to do that and opportunities, with my family and domestic violence in industrial well-established his arrangement over the next shownest emissions target, in this country.
That is a process also we do is to a broader where most horrific nature would be very aware of cash law, the first Budget will be doing that at the next election, the strength of my family and for up to George.
The other thing that is necessary to $50 million in up in New Zealand for the 50 of terrorism in their homes and they’re focusing on this and the states and territories, how we've been tracking and what we've seen in control of that.
Will under Labor was already working around the record hand on the National Party they’ve been able to bring some assistance, this is the Labor Party in New South Wales, we will remain at its beauty.
This is a state - but we thought trust I suspect when they're going to make.
There are a death-weakness and it was such a property of Australians that’s a boy of people.
